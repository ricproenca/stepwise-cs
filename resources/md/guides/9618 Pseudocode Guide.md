     How should teachers use this guide?                                                                                                                     5

         Introduction

         How should teachers use this guide?
         We advise teachers to follow this guide in their teaching and make sure that learners are familiar with the
         style presented here. This will enable learners to understand any pseudocode presented in examination papers
         more easily. It will also give them a structure to follow so that they can present their algorithms more clearly
         in pseudocode when required.

         Learners should be encouraged to follow this guide in their examination answers or any other material they
         present for assessment. By definition, pseudocode is not a programming language with a defined, mandatory
         syntax. Any pseudocode presented by candidates will only be assessed for the logic of the solution presented
         – where the logic is understood by the Examiner, and correctly solves the problem addressed, the candidate
         will be given credit regardless of whether the candidate has followed the style presented here. However,
         candidates are required to write pseudocode for questions that require answers in pseudocode and not a
         programming language. Using a recommended style will enable the candidate to communicate their solution
         to the Examiner more effectively.

          1 Pseudocode in examined components

          The following information sets out how pseudocode will appear within the examined components and is
          provided to allow you to give learners familiarity before the exam.

          1.1 Font style and size
          Pseudocode is presented in a monospaced (fixed-width) font such as Courier New. The size of the font will
          be consistent throughout.

          1.2 Indentation
          Lines are indented (usually by three spaces) to indicate that they are contained within a statement in a
          previous line. In cases where line numbering is used, this indentation may be omitted. Every effort will be
          made to make sure that code statements are not longer than a line of text unless this is absolutely necessary.
          Where necessary, continuation lines will be aligned to maximise readability.

          1.3 Case
          Keywords are in upper-case, e.g. IF, REPEAT, PROCEDURE. (Different keywords are explained in later
          sections of this guide.)

          Identifiers are in mixed case (sometimes referred to as camelCase or Pascal case) with upper-case letters
          indicating the beginning of new words, for example NumberOfPlayers.

          Meta-variables – symbols in the pseudocode that should be substituted by other symbols are enclosed in
          angled brackets < > (as in Backus-Naur Form). This is also used in this guide.

           Example – meta-variables

           REPEAT
              <statement(s)>
           UNTIL <condition>

                   Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Pseudocode in examined components

         1.4 Lines and line numbering
         Where it is necessary to number the lines of pseudocode so that they can be referred to, line numbers are
         presented to the left of the pseudocode with sufficient space to indicate clearly that they are not part of the
         pseudocode statements.

         Line numbers are consecutive, unless numbers are skipped to indicate that part of the code is missing. This will
         also be clearly stated.

         Each line representing a statement is numbered. However, when a statement runs over one line of text, the
         continuation lines are not numbered.

         1.5 Comments
         Comments are preceded by two forward slashes //. The comment continues until the end of the line. For
         multi-line comments, each line is preceded by //.

         Normally the comment is on a separate line before, and at the same level of indentation as, the code it refers
         to. Occasionally, however, a short comment that refers to a single line may be at the end of the line to which
         it refers.

           Example – comments

           // this procedure swaps
           // values of X and Y
           PROCEDURE SWAP(BYREF X : INTEGER, Y : INTEGER)
              Temp ← X    // temporarily store X
              X ← Y
              Y ← Temp
           ENDPROCEDURE

          2 Variables, constants and data types

          2.1 Data Types
          The following keywords are used to designate some basic data types:

          •   INTEGER       a whole number
          •   REAL          a number capable of containing a fractional part
          •   CHAR          a single character
          •   STRING        a sequence of zero or more characters
          •   BOOLEAN the logical values TRUE and FALSE
          •   DATE          a valid calendar date

          2.2 Literals
          Literals of the above data types are written as follows:

          •   Integer     Written as normal in the denary system, e.g. 5, –3
          •   Real	Always written with at least one digit on either side of the decimal point, zeros being added if
                    necessary, e.g. 4.7, 0.3, –4.0, 0.0
          •   Char        A single character delimited by single quotes e.g. ꞌxꞌ, ꞌCꞌ, ꞌ@ꞌ
          • String        Delimited by double quotes. A string may contain no characters (i.e. the empty string)
          		              e.g. "This is a string", ""
          •   Boolean TRUE, FALSE
          •   Date	This will normally be written in the format dd/mm/yyyy. However, it is good practice to state
                    explicitly that this value is of data type DATE and to explain the format (as the convention for
                    representing dates varies across the world).

          2.3 Identifiers
          Identifiers (the names given to variables, constants, procedures and functions) are in mixed case. They can
          only contain letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9) and the underscore character ( _ ). They must start with a letter
          and not a digit. Accented letters should not be used.

          It is good practice to use identifier names that describe the variable, procedure or function they refer to. Single
          letters may be used where these are conventional (such as i and j when dealing with array indices, or X and
          Y when dealing with coordinates) as these are made clear by the convention.

          Keywords identified elsewhere in this guide should never be used as variable names.

          Identifiers should be considered case insensitive, for example, Countdown and CountDown should not be
          used as separate variable names.

         2.4 Variable declarations
         It is good practice to declare variables explicitly in pseudocode.

         Declarations are made as follows:

         DECLARE <identifier> : <data type>

           Example – variable declarations

           DECLARE Counter : INTEGER
           DECLARE TotalToPay : REAL
           DECLARE GameOver : BOOLEAN

         2.5 Constants
         It is good practice to use constants if this makes the pseudocode more readable, as an identifier is more
         meaningful in many cases than a literal. It also makes the pseudocode easier to update if the value of the
         constant changes.

         Constants are normally declared at the beginning of a piece of pseudocode (unless it is desirable to restrict the
         scope of the constant).

         Constants are declared by stating the identifier and the literal value in the following format:

         CONSTANT <identifier> = <value>

           Example – constant declarations

           CONSTANT HourlyRate = 6.50
           CONSTANT DefaultText = "N/A"

         Only literals can be used as the value of a constant. A variable, another constant or an expression must never
         be used.

          2.6 Assignments
          The assignment operator is ← .

          Assignments should be made in the following format:

          <identifier> ← <value>

          The identifier must refer to a variable (this can be an individual element in a data structure such as an array or
          a user defined data type). The value may be any expression that evaluates to a value of the same data type as
          the variable.

            Example – assignments

            Counter ← 0
            Counter ← Counter + 1
            TotalToPay ← NumberOfHours * HourlyRate

         3 Arrays

           Syllabus requirements

           The Cambridge International AS & A Level syllabus (9618) requires candidates to understand and use both
           one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.

         3.1 Declaring arrays
         Arrays are considered to be fixed-length structures of elements of identical data type, accessible by
         consecutive index (subscript) numbers. It is good practice to explicitly state what the lower bound of the array
         (i.e. the index of the first element) is because this defaults to either 0 or 1 in different systems. Generally, a
         lower bound of 1 will be used.

         Square brackets are used to indicate the array indices.

         A one-dimensional array is declared as follows:

         DECLARE <identifier>:ARRAY[<lower>:<upper>] OF <data type>

         A two-dimensional array is declared as follows:

         DECLARE <identifier>:ARRAY
                                   [<lower1>:<upper1>,<lower2>:<upper2>]
                                   OF <data type>

           Example – array declarations

           DECLARE StudentNames : ARRAY[1:30] OF STRING
           DECLARE NoughtsAndCrosses : ARRAY[1:3,1:3] OF CHAR

         3.2 Using arrays
         Array index values may be literal values or expressions that evaluate to a valid integer value.

           Example – accessing individual array elements

           StudentNames[1] ← "Ali"
           NoughtsAndCrosses[2,3] ← ꞌXꞌ
           StudentNames[n+1] ← StudentNames[n]

Back to contents page                                                                    www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel          11

Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Variables, constants and data types

          Arrays can be used in assignment statements (provided they have same size and data type). The following is
          therefore allowed:

            Example – accessing a complete array

            SavedGame ← NoughtsAndCrosses

          A statement should not refer to a group of array elements individually. For example, the following
          construction should not be used.

          StudentNames [1 TO 30] ← ""

          Instead, an appropriate loop structure is used to assign the elements individually. For example:

            Example – assigning a group of array elements

            FOR Index ← 1 TO 30
               StudentNames[Index] ← ""
            NEXT Index

         4 User-defined data types

           Syllabus requirements

           The Cambridge International AS & A Level syllabus (9618) requires candidates to understand that data
           structures that are not available in a particular programming language need to be constructed from the
           data structures that are built-in within the language. User-defined data types need to be defined. The
           syllabus requires candidates to use and define non-composite data types such as enumerated and pointer
           and composite data types such as record, set, class/object. Abstract Data Types (ADTs) stack, queue,
           linked list, dictionary and binary tree are also defined as composite data types.

         4.1 Defining user-defined data types
         Non-composite data type: enumerated
         A user-defined non-composite data type with a list of possible values is called an enumerated data type. The
         enumerated type should be declared as follows:

         TYPE <identifier> = (value1, value2, value3, ...)

           Example – declaration of enumerated type

           This enumerated type holds data about seasons of the year.

           TYPE Season = (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)

         Non-composite data type: pointer
         A user-defined non-composite data type referencing a memory location is called a pointer. The pointer should
         be declared as follows:

         TYPE <identifier> = ^<data type>

         The ^ shows that the variable is a pointer and the data type indicates the type of the data stored in the
         memory location.

           Example – declarations of pointer type

           TYPE TIntPointer = ^INTEGER
           TYPE TCharPointer = ^CHAR

         Declaration of a variable of pointer type does not require the ^ (caret) symbol to be used.

           Example – declaration of a pointer variable

           DECLARE MyPointer : TIntPointer

Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. User-defined data types

          Composite data type
          A composite data type is a collection of data that can consist of one or more data types, grouped under one
          identifier.

          Composite data type – Record
          The record composite data type should be declared as follows:

          TYPE <identifier1>
             DECLARE <identifier2> : <data type>
             DECLARE <identifier3> : <data type>
             ...
          ENDTYPE

           Example – declaration of Record data type

           This user-defined data type holds data about a student.

           TYPE StudentRecord
              DECLARE LastName : STRING
              DECLARE FirstName : STRING
              DECLARE DateOfBirth : DATE
              DECLARE YearGroup : INTEGER
              DECLARE FormGroup : CHAR
           ENDTYPE

          Composite data type – Set
          The set composite data type should be declared as follows:

          TYPE <identifier1> = SET OF <data type>
          DEFINE <identifier2> (value1, value2, value, … ) : <identifier1>

           Example – declaration of Set data type

           This user-defined data type holds data about vowels.

           TYPE LetterSet = SET OF CHAR
           DEFINE Vowels ('A','E','I','O','U'): LetterSet

         4.2 Using user-defined data types
         When a user-defined data type has been defined it can be used in the same way as any other data type in
         declarations.

         Variables of a user-defined data type can be assigned to each other. Individual data items are accessed using
         dot notation.

           Example – using user-defined data types

           This pseudocode uses the user-defined types StudentRecord, Season and TIntPointer defined in
           the previous section.

           DECLARE Pupil1 : StudentRecord
           DECLARE Pupil2 : StudentRecord
           DECLARE Form : ARRAY[1:30] OF StudentRecord
           DECLARE ThisSeason : Season
           DECLARE NextSeason : Season
           DECLARE MyPointer : TIntPointer

           Pupil1.LastName ← "Johnson"
           Pupil1.Firstname ← "Leroy"
           Pupil1.DateOfBirth ← 02/01/2005
           Pupil1.YearGroup ← 6
           Pupil1.FormGroup ← ꞌAꞌ

           Pupil2 ← Pupil1

           FOR Index ← 1 TO 30
              Form[Index].YearGroup ← Form[Index].YearGroup + 1
           NEXT Index

           ThisSeason ← Spring
           MyPointer ← ^ThisSeason
           NextSeason ← MyPointer^ + 1
           // access the value stored at the memory address

          5 Common operations

          5.1 Input and output
          Values are input using the INPUT command as follows:

          INPUT <identifier>

          The identifier should be a variable (that may be an individual element of a data structure such as an array, or a
          custom data type).

          Values are output using the OUTPUT command as follows:

          OUTPUT <value(s)>

          Several values, separated by commas, can be output using the same command.

           Example – INPUT and OUTPUT statements

           INPUT Answer
           OUTPUT Score
           OUTPUT "You have ", Lives, " lives left"

          5.2 Arithmetic operations
          Standard arithmetic operator symbols are used:

          + Addition

          – Subtraction

          * Multiplication

          / Division (The resulting value should be of data type REAL, even if the operands are integers.)

          DIV Integer division: Used to find the quotient (integer number before the decimal point) after division.

          MOD or Modulus: The remainder that is left over when one number is divided by another.

          Multiplication and division have higher precedence over addition and subtraction (this is the normal
          mathematical convention). However, it is good practice to make the order of operations in complex
          expressions explicit by using parentheses.

         5.3 Relational operations
         The following symbols are used for relational operators (also known as comparison operators):

         > Greater than

         < Less than

         >= Greater than or equal to

         <= Less than or equal to

         = Equal to

         <> Not equal to

         The result of these operations is always of data type BOOLEAN.

         In complex expressions it is advisable to use parentheses to make the order of operations explicit.

         5.4 Logic operators
         The only logic operators (also called relational operators) used are AND, OR and NOT. The operands and
         results of these operations are always of data type BOOLEAN.

         In complex expressions it is advisable to use parentheses to make the order of operations explicit.

         5.5 String functions and operations
           Syllabus requirements

           The Cambridge International AS & A Level syllabus (9618) specifically requires candidates to know string
           manipulation functions in their chosen programming language. Pseudocode string manipulation functions
           will always be provided in examinations. Some basic string manipulation functions are given here.

         Each function returns an error if the function call is not properly formed.

           RIGHT(ThisString : STRING, x : INTEGER) RETURNS STRING
           returns rightmost x characters from ThisString

           Example: RIGHT("ABCDEFGH", 3) returns "FGH"

           LENGTH(ThisString : STRING) RETURNS INTEGER
           returns the integer value representing the length of ThisString

           Example: LENGTH("Happy Days") returns 10

Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Common operations

           MID(ThisString : STRING, x : INTEGER, y : INTEGER) RETURNS STRING
           returns a string of length y starting at position x from ThisString

           Example: MID("ABCDEFGH", 2, 3) returns "BCD"

           LCASE(ThisChar : CHAR) RETURNS CHAR
           returns the character value representing the lower-case equivalent of ThisChar
           If ThisChar is not an upper-case alphabetic character, it is returned unchanged.

           Example: LCASE(ꞌWꞌ) returns ꞌwꞌ

           UCASE(ThisChar : CHAR) RETURNS CHAR
           returns the character value representing the upper-case equivalent of ThisChar
           If ThisChar is not a lower-case alphabetic character, it is returned unchanged.

           Example: UCASE(ꞌhꞌ) returns ꞌHꞌ

          In pseudocode, the operator & is used to concatenate (join) two strings.

          Example: “Summer” & “ “ & “Pudding” produces “Summer Pudding”

          Where string operations (such as concatenation, searching and splitting) are used in a programming language,
          these should be explained clearly, as they vary considerably between systems.

          Where functions in programming languages are used to format numbers as strings for output, their use should
          also be explained.

          5.6 Numeric functions
           INT(x : REAL) RETURNS INTEGER
           returns the integer part of x

           Example: INT(27.5415) returns 27

           RAND(x : INTEGER) RETURNS REAL
           returns a random real number in the range 0 to x (not inclusive of x)

           Example: RAND(87) may return 35.43

         6 Selection

         6.1 IF statements
         IF statements may or may not have an ELSE clause.

         IF statements without an else clause are written as follows:

         IF <condition> THEN
            <statement(s)>
         ENDIF

         IF statements with an else clause are written as follows:

         IF <condition> THEN
            <statement(s)>
         ELSE
            <statement(s)>
         ENDIF

         Note, due to space constraints, the THEN and ELSE clauses may only be indented by two spaces rather than
         three. (They are, in a sense, a continuation of the IF statement rather than separate statements).

           Example – nested IF statements

           IF ChallengerScore > ChampionScore THEN
              IF ChallengerScore > HighestScore THEN
                 OUTPUT ChallengerName, " is champion and highest scorer"
              ELSE
                 OUTPUT ChallengerName, " is the new champion"
              ENDIF
           ELSE

          6.2 CASE statements
          CASE statements allow one out of several branches of code to be executed, depending on the value of a
          variable.

          CASE statements are written as follows:

          CASE OF <identifier>
             <value 1> : 
                         <statement1>
                         <statement2>
                         ...
             <value 2> : 
                         <statement1>
                         <statement2>
                         ...
             ...
          ENDCASE

          An OTHERWISE clause can be the last case:

          CASE OF <identifier>
             <value 1> : 
                         <statement1>
                         <statement2>
                         ...
             <value 2> : 
                         <statement1>
                         <statement2>
                         ...
             OTHERWISE : 
                         <statement1>
                         <statement2>
                         ...
          ENDCASE

          Each value may be represented by a range, for example:

          <value1> TO <value2> : 
                                 <statement1>
                                 <statement2>
                                 ...

          Note that the CASE clauses are tested in sequence. When a case that applies is found, its statement is
          executed and the CASE statement is complete. Control is passed to the statement after the ENDCASE. Any
          remaining cases are not tested.

          If present, an OTHERWISE clause must be the last case. Its statement will be executed if none of the
          preceding cases apply.

           Example – formatted CASE statement

           INPUT Move
           CASE OF Move
              ꞌWꞌ : Position ← Position − 10
              ꞌSꞌ : Position ← Position + 10
              ꞌAꞌ : Position ← Position − 1
              ꞌDꞌ : Position ← Position + 1

         7 Iteration (repetition)

         7.1 Count-controlled (FOR) loops
         Count-controlled loops are written as follows:

         FOR <identifier> ← <value1> TO <value2>
            <statement(s)>
         NEXT <identifier>

         The identifier must be a variable of data type INTEGER, and the values should be expressions that evaluate
         to integers.

         The variable is assigned each of the integer values from value1 to value2 inclusive, running the
         statements inside the FOR loop after each assignment. If value1 = value2 the statements will be
         executed once, and if value1 > value2 the statements will not be executed.

         It is good practice to repeat the identifier after NEXT, particularly with nested FOR loops.

         An increment can be specified as follows:

         FOR <identifier> ← <value1> TO <value2> STEP <increment>
            <statement(s)>
         NEXT <identifier>

         The increment must be an expression that evaluates to an integer. In this case the identifier will be
         assigned the values from value1 in successive increments of increment until it reaches value2. If it
         goes past value2, the loop terminates. The increment can be negative.

           Example – nested FOR loops

           Total ← 0
           FOR Row ← 1 TO MaxRow
              RowTotal ← 0
              FOR Column ← 1 TO 10
                 RowTotal ← RowTotal + Amount[Row, Column]
              NEXT Column
              OUTPUT "Total for Row ", Row, " is ", RowTotal
              Total ← Total + RowTotal
           NEXT Row
           OUTPUT "The grand total is ", Total

         7.2 Post-condition (REPEAT) loops
         Post-condition loops are written as follows:

         REPEAT
            <statement(s)>
         UNTIL <condition>

Back to contents page                                                                    www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel         21

Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Iteration (repetition)

          The condition must be an expression that evaluates to a Boolean.

          The statements in the loop will be executed at least once. The condition is tested after the statements are
          executed and if it evaluates to TRUE the loop terminates, otherwise the statements are executed again.

            Example – REPEAT UNTIL loop

            REPEAT
               OUTPUT "Please enter the password"
               INPUT Password
            UNTIL Password = "Secret"

          7.3 Pre-condition (WHILE) loops
          Pre-condition loops are written as follows:

          WHILE <condition>
             <statement(s)>
          ENDWHILE

          The condition must be an expression that evaluates to a Boolean.

          The condition is tested before the statements, and the statements will only be executed if the condition
          evaluates to TRUE. After the statements have been executed the condition is tested again. The loop
          terminates when the condition evaluates to FALSE.

          The statements will not be executed if, on the first test, the condition evaluates to FALSE.

            Example – WHILE loop

            WHILE Number > 9
               Number ← Number – 9
            ENDWHILE

         8 Procedures and functions

           Syllabus requirements

           The definition and use of procedures and functions is explicitly required in the Cambridge International AS
           & A Level syllabus (9618). Any pseudocode functions used in an examination will be defined.

         8.1 Defining and calling procedures
         A procedure with no parameters is defined as follows:

         PROCEDURE <identifier>()
            <statement(s)>
         ENDPROCEDURE

         A procedure with parameters is defined as follows:

         PROCEDURE <identifier>(<param1> : <data type>, <param2> : <data type>...)
            <statement(s)>
         ENDPROCEDURE

         The <identifier> is the identifier used to call the procedure. Where used, param1, param2 etc. are
         identifiers for the parameters of the procedure. These will be used as variables in the statements of the
         procedure.

         Procedures defined as above should be called as follows, respectively:

         CALL <identifier>()

         CALL <identifier>(value1, value2, ...)

         These calls are complete program statements.

         When parameters are used, value1, value2... must be of the correct data type and in the same
         sequence as in the definition of the procedure.

         Unless otherwise stated, it should be assumed that parameters are passed by value. (See section 8.3).

Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Procedures and functions

           Example – definition and use of procedures with and without parameters

           PROCEDURE DefaultSquare()
              CALL Square(100)
           ENDPROCEDURE

           PROCEDURE Square(Size : INTEGER)
              FOR Side ← 1 TO 4
                 CALL MoveForward(Size)
                 CALL Turn(90)
              NEXT Side
           ENDPROCEDURE

           IF Size = Default THEN
              CALL DefaultSquare()
           ELSE
              CALL Square(Size)
           ENDIF

          8.2 Defining and calling functions
          Functions operate in a similar way to procedures, except that in addition they return a single value to the
          point at which they are called. Their definition includes the data type of the value returned.

          A function with no parameters is defined as follows:

          FUNCTION <identifier>() RETURNS <data type>
             <statement(s)>
          ENDFUNCTION

          A function with parameters is defined as follows:

          FUNCTION <identifier>(
                                <param1> : <data type>,
                                <param2> : <data type>...) RETURNS <data type>
             <statement(s)>
          ENDFUNCTION

          The keyword RETURN is used as one of the statements within the body of the function to specify the value
          to be returned. Normally, this will be the last statement in the function definition, however, if the RETURN
          statement is in the body of the function its execution is immediate and any subsequent lines of code are
          omitted.

          Because a function returns a value that is used when the function is called, function calls are not complete
          program statements. The keyword CALL should not be used when calling a function. Functions should only
          be called as part of an expression. When the RETURN statement is executed, the value returned replaces the
          function call in the expression and the expression is then evaluated.

           Example – definition and use of a function

           FUNCTION Max(Number1 : INTEGER, Number2 : INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
              IF Number1 > Number2 THEN
                 RETURN Number1
              ELSE
                 RETURN Number2
              ENDIF
           ENDFUNCTION

           OUTPUT "Penalty Fine = ", Max(10, Distance*2)

         8.3 Passing parameters by value or by reference
         To specify whether a parameter is passed by value or by reference, the keywords BYVAL and BYREF precede
         the parameter in the definition of the procedure. If there are several parameters passed by the same method,
         the BYVAL or BYREF keyword need not be repeated.

           Example – passing parameters by reference

           PROCEDURE SWAP(BYREF X : INTEGER, Y : INTEGER)
              Temp ← X
              X ← Y
              Y ← Temp
           ENDPROCEDURE

         If the method for passing parameters is not specified, passing by value is assumed. How this should be called
         and how it operates has already been explained in Section 8.1.

         Parameters should not be passed by reference to a function.

          9 File handling

          9.1 Handling text files
          Text files consist of lines of text that are read or written consecutively as strings.

          A file must be opened in a specified mode before any file operations are attempted. This is written as follows:

          OPENFILE <file identifier> FOR <file mode>

          The file identifier may be a literal string containing the file names, or a variable of type STRING that has been
          assigned the file name.

          The following file modes are used:

          •   READ         for data to be read from the file
          •   WRITE	for data to be written to the file. A new file will be created and any existing data in the file will
                     be lost.
          •   APPEND for data to be added to the file, after any existing data.

          A file should be opened in only one mode at a time.

          Data is read from the file (after the file has been opened in READ mode) using the READFILE command as
          follows:

          READFILE <file identifier>, <variable>

          The variable should be of data type STRING. When the command is executed, the next line of text in the
          file is read and assigned to the variable.

          The function EOF is used to test whether there are any more lines to be read from a given file. It is called as
          follows:

          EOF(<file identifier>)

          This function returns TRUE if there are no more lines to read (or if an empty file has been opened in READ
          mode) and FALSE otherwise.

          Data is written into the file (after the file has been opened in WRITE or APPEND mode) using the
          WRITEFILE command as follows:

          WRITEFILE <file identifier>, <data>

          Files should be closed when they are no longer needed using the CLOSEFILE command as follows:

          CLOSEFILE <file identifier>

                                        Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. File handling

           Example – handling text files

           This example uses the operations together, to copy all the lines from FileA.txt to FileB.txt,
           replacing any blank lines by a line of dashes.

           DECLARE LineOfText : STRING
           OPENFILE "FileA.txt" FOR READ
           OPENFILE "FileB.txt" FOR WRITE
           WHILE NOT EOF("FileA.txt")
              READFILE "FileA.txt", LineOfText
              IF LineOfText = "" THEN
                 WRITEFILE "FileB.txt", " ----------------------------"
              ELSE
                 WRITEFILE "FileB.txt", LineOfText
              ENDIF
           ENDWHILE
           CLOSEFILE "FileA.txt"
           CLOSEFILE "FileB.txt"

         9.2 Handling random files
         Random files contain a collection of data, normally as records of fixed length. They can be thought of as
         having a file pointer which can be moved to any location or address in the file. The record at that location can
         then be read or written.

         Random files are opened using the RANDOM file mode as follows:

         OPENFILE <file identifier> FOR RANDOM

         As with text files, the file identifier will normally be the name of the file.

         The SEEK command moves the file pointer to a given location:

         SEEK <file identifier>, <address>

         The address should be an expression that evaluates to an integer which indicates the location of a record to
         be read or written. This is usually the number of records from the beginning of the file. It is good practice to
         explain how the addresses are computed.

         The command GETRECORD should be used to read the record at the file pointer:

         GETRECORD <file identifier>, <variable>

         When this command is executed, the record that is read is assigned to the variable which must be of the
         appropriate data type for that record (usually a user-defined type).

Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9618 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. File handling

          The command PUTRECORD is used to write a record into the file at the file pointer:

          PUTRECORD <file identifier>, <variable>

          When this command is executed, the data in the variable is inserted into the record at the file pointer. Any
          data that was previously at this location will be replaced.

           Example – handling random files

           The records from positions 10 to 20 of a file StudentFile.Dat are moved to the next position and
           a new record is inserted into position 10. The example uses the user-defined type Student defined in
           Section 4.1.

           DECLARE Pupil : Student
           DECLARE NewPupil : Student
           DECLARE Position : INTEGER

           NewPupil.LastName ← "Johnson"
           NewPupil.Firstname ← "Leroy"
           NewPupil.DateOfBirth ← 02/01/2005
           NewPupil.YearGroup ← 6
           NewPupil.FormGroup ← ꞌAꞌ

           OPENFILE "StudentFile.Dat" FOR RANDOM
           FOR Position ← 20 TO 10 STEP -1
              SEEK "StudentFile.Dat", Position
              GETRECORD "StudentFile.Dat", Pupil
              SEEK "StudentFile.Dat", Position + 1
              PUTRECORD "StudentFile.Dat", Pupil
           NEXT Position

           SEEK "StudentFile.Dat", 10
           PUTRECORD "StudentFile.Dat", NewPupil

           CLOSEFILE "StudentFile.dat"

         10 Object-oriented Programming

         10.1 Methods and Properties
         Methods and properties can be assumed to be public unless otherwise stated. Where the access level is
         relevant to the question, it will be explicit in the code using the keywords PUBLIC or PRIVATE.

           Example code

           PRIVATE Attempts : INTEGER
           Attempts ← 3

           PUBLIC PROCEDURE SetAttempts(Number : INTEGER)
              Attempts ← Number
           ENDPROCEDURE

           PRIVATE FUNCTION GetAttempts() RETURNS INTEGER
              RETURN Attempts
           ENDFUNCTION

         Methods will be called using object methods, for example:

         Player.SetAttempts(5)
         OUTPUT Player.GetAttempts()

         10.2 Constructors and Inheritance
         Constructors will be procedures with the name NEW.

         CLASS Pet
            PRIVATE Name : STRING
            PUBLIC PROCEDURE NEW(GivenName : STRING)
               Name ← GivenName
            ENDPROCEDURE
         ENDCLASS

         Inheritance is denoted by the INHERITS keyword; superclass/parent class methods will be called using the
         keyword SUPER, for example:

         CLASS Cat INHERITS Pet
            PRIVATE Breed: INTEGER
            PUBLIC PROCEDURE NEW(GivenName : STRING, GivenBreed : STRING)
               SUPER.NEW(GivenName)
               Breed ← GivenBreed
            ENDPROCEDURE
         ENDCLASS

          To create an object, the following format is used:

          <object name> ← NEW <class name>(<param1>, <param2> ...)

          For example:

          MyCat ← NEW Cat("Kitty", "Shorthaired")

17.1 Encryption
Key terms
Eavesdropper – a person who intercepts data being transmitted.
Plaintext – the original text/document/message before it is put through an encryption
algorithm.
Ciphertext – the product when plaintext is put through an encryption algorithm.
Block cipher – the encryption of a number of contiguous bits in one go rather than one bit at a
time.
Stream cipher – the encryption of bits in sequence as they arrive at the encryption algorithm.
Block chaining – form of encryption, in which the previous block of ciphertext is XORed with
the block of plaintext and then encrypted thus preventing identical plaintext blocks producing
identical ciphertext.
Symmetric encryption – encryption in which the same secret key is used to encrypt and
decrypt messages.
Key distribution problem – security issue inherent in symmetric encryption arising from the
fact that, when sending the secret key to a recipient, there is the risk that the key can be
intercepted by an eavesdropper/hacker.
Asymmetric encryption – encryption that uses public keys (known to everyone) and private
keys (secret keys).
Public key – encryption/decryption key known to all users.
Private key – encryption/decryption key which is known only to a single user/computer.

17.1.1 Encryption keys, plaintext and ciphertext
Why do we need encryption?
When data is transmitted over any public network (wired or wireless), there is a risk of it being
intercepted by, for example, a hacker (sometimes referred to as an eavesdropper). Using
encryption helps to minimise this risk.
Encryption alters data into a form that is unreadable by anybody for whom the data is not
intended. It cannot prevent the data being intercepted, but it stops it from making any sense to
the eavesdropper. This is particularly important if the data is sensitive (for example, medical or
legal documents) or confidential (for example, credit card or bank details).
There are four main security concerns when data is transmitted: confidentiality, authenticity,
integrity and non-repudiation.
1 Confidentiality is where only the intended recipient should be able to read or decipher the
   data.
2 Authenticity is the need to identify who sent the data and verify that the source is legitimate.
3 Integrity is that data should reach its destination without any changes.
4 Non-repudiation is that neither the sender nor the recipient should be able to deny that they
   were part of the data transmission which just took place.

Plaintext and ciphertext
The original data being sent is known as plaintext. Once it has gone through an encryption
algorithm, it produces ciphertext. Figure 17.1 summarises what happens.

Figure 17.1

Note that, when encrypting text, block cipher is usually used. Here, the encryption algorithm is
applied to a group of contiguous bits (for example, 128 bits) rather than one bit at a time (which
is known as stream cipher). With block cipher, each plaintext block is XORed with the previous
ciphertext block and then encrypted – this is known as block chaining. This prevents identical
blocks of plaintext producing the same ciphertext each time they are encrypted.
Notice the use of encryption and decryption keys in Figure 17.1. These keys will be considered
in the next section.

17.1.2 Symmetric encryption
Symmetric encryption uses a secret key; the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the
encoded message.
Consider a simple system which uses 10-denary-digit encryption (which gives about 10 billion
possibilities). Suppose our secret key is 4 2 9 1 3 6 2 8 5 6, which means each letter in a word is
shifted across the alphabet +4, +2, +9, and so on, places.
For example, here is the message, ‘computer science is exciting’ before and after the 10-denary-
digit secret key is applied:

Figure 17.2

However, modern computers could ‘crack’ this key (and, therefore, decrypt the message) in a
few seconds. To combat this, we use 256-bit encryption (in other words, a 256-bit key) which
gives 2256 possible combinations. Even this may not be enough, as computers become more
powerful.
One issue with symmetric encryption is that both sender and recipient need to use the same
secret key. This is a security risk here, since the sender has to supply the key to the recipient.
This key could be intercepted. This is referred to as the key distribution problem.
So, how can both sender and receiver have the required secret key without sending it
electronically? The following routine shows one possibility.

 stage sender                                           recipient
 1        uses an encryption algorithm and chooses      uses the same algorithm and also chooses
          a secret value, such as X = 2                 a secret value, such as Y = 4
 2        this value of X is put into a simple          the value of Y is put into the same
          algorithm:                                    algorithm:
          Note: MOD gives the remainder when dividing a number by 11
          7X (MOD 11) = 72 (MOD 11)                     7Y (MOD 11) = 74 (MOD 11)
          = 49 (MOD 11)                                 = 2401 (MOD 11)
          = 4 remainder 5                               = 218 remainder 3
          So, the value is 5                            So, the value is 3
 3        the sender sends the value just calculated    the recipient sends the value just
          (5) to the recipient                          calculated (3) to the sender
 4        the new value from the recipient replaces     the new value from the sender replaces 7
          7 in the original algorithm:                  in the original algorithm:

             3X (MOD 11) = 32 (MOD 11)               5Y (MOD 11) = 54 (MOD 11)
             = 0 remainder 9                         = 625 (MOD 11)
             So, the new value is 9                  = 56 remainder 9
                                                     So, the new value is 9
Table 17.1

Both sender and recipient end up with the same encryption and decryption key of 9. This is
oversimplified; in practice, computers would generate much larger keys (possibly 256 bits –
equivalent to 64 denary digits if using BCD).
There are many other ways to keep the encryption key secret. But the issue of security is always
the main drawback of symmetrical encryption, since a single key is required for both sender and
recipient.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 17A
Using the following sender and receiver values to check that the method described above
works.
a) Sender uses the value X = 3 and the receiver uses the value Y = 5
b) Sender uses the value X = 7 and the receiver uses the value Y = 6

17.1.3 Asymmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption uses two keys – a public key, available to all users, and a private key,
known to a specific person or computer.
Suppose Tom and Meera work for the same company. Tom wishes to send a confidential
document to Meera. Here’s how he could do it.
Step 1: Tom and Meera both use an algorithm to generate their own matching pairs of keys
(private and public) which they keep stored on their computers. The matching pairs of keys are
mathematically linked but cannot be derived from each other.
Step 2:

Figure 17.3

Step 3: Tom now uses Meera’s public key (▦) to encrypt the document he wishes to send to her.
He then sends his encrypted document (ciphertext) to Meera.
Step 4: Meera uses her matching private key (▧) to unlock Tom’s document and decrypt it. This
works because the public key used to encrypt the document and the private key used to decrypt it
are a matching pair generated on Meera’s computer.
Meera can exchange her public key with any number of people working in the company, so she
is able to receive encrypted messages (which have been encrypted using her public key) and she
can then decrypt them using her matching private key:

Figure 17.4

If a two-way communication is required between all five workers, then they all need to generate
their own matching public and private keys. Once this is done, all users then need to swap public
keys so that they can send encrypted documents, files or messages between each other. Each
worker will then use their own private key to decrypt information being sent to them.
However, there are still issues. For example, how can Meera be certain that the document came
from Tom, and that it has not been tampered with during transmission? Additional security is

required; this will be discussed in Section 17.4.

17.2 Quantum cryptography
Key terms
Quantum cryptography – cryptography based on the laws of quantum mechanics (the
properties of photons).
Quantum key distribution (QKD) – protocol which uses quantum mechanics to securely
send encryption keys over fibre optic networks.
Qubit – the basic unit of a quantum of information (quantum bit).

Quantum cryptography utilises the physics of photons (light energy according to the formula E
= hf) and their physical quantum properties to produce a virtually unbreakable encryption
system. This helps protect the security of data being transmitted over fibre optic cables.
Photons oscillate in various directions and produce a sequence of random bits (0s and 1s) across
the optical network.
Sending encryption keys across a network uses quantum cryptography – a quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocol (one of the most common is BB84).
QKD uses quantum mechanics to facilitate the secure transmission of encryption keys. Quantum
mechanics use a qubit (quantum bit) as the basic unit of quantum data. Unlike normal binary
(which uses discrete 0s and 1s), the state of a qubit can be 0 or 1, but it can also be both 0 and 1
simultaneously. Figure 17.5 shows a representation of a photon and how a photon can be
affected by one of four types of polarising filter.

Figure 17.5

So, how do we use quantum cryptography to send an encryption key from ‘A’ to ‘B’ using the
QKD protocol?

Stage 1: The sender uses a light source to generate photons.
Stage 2: The photons are sent through four random polarisers (see Figure 17.2) which randomly
give one of four possible polarisations and bit values:
vertical polarisation ≡ 1 bit
horizontal polarisation ≡ 0 bit
45° right polarisation ≡ 1 bit
                                diagonal polarisation shows 0 bit and 1 bit simultaneously
45° left polarisation ≡ 0 bit
Stage 3: The polarised photon travels along a fibre optic cable to its destination.
Stage 4: At the destination, there are two beam splitters:
diagonal splitter            ⊠ ‘X’
vertical/horizontal splitter ⊞ ‘Y’
and two photon detectors.
Stage 5: One of the two beam splitters is chosen at random and the photon detectors are read.
Stage 6: The whole process is repeated until the whole of the encryption key has been
transmitted from ‘A’ to ‘B’.
Stage 7: The recipient sends back the sequence of beam splitters that were used (for example,
XXXYYXXYYXXYYYYY) to the sender.
Stage 8: The sender now compares this sequence to the polarisation sequence used at the
sending station.
Stage 9: The sender now informs the recipient where in the sequence the correct beam splitters
were used.
Stage 10: This now ensures that the sender and recipient are fully synchronised.
Stage 11: The encryption key can again be sent and received safely; even if intercepted, the
eavesdropper would find it almost impossible to read the encryption key making the whole
process extremely secure. Encrypted messages can now be sent along the fibre optic cable with
the decryption key being used to decode all messages.
Despite the advantages of quantum cryptography, there are some potential drawbacks:
• It requires a dedicated line and specialist hardware, which can be expensive to implement
  initially.
• It still has a limited range (at the time of writing the limit is about 250 km).
• It is possible for the polarisation of the light to be altered (due to various conditions) while
  travelling down fibre optic cables.
• Due to the inherent security system generated by quantuin cryptography, terrorists and other
  criminals can use the technology to hide their activities from government law enforcers.

17.3 Protocols
Key terms
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) – security protocol used when sending data over the internet.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) – a more up-to-date version of SSL.
Handshake – the process of initiating communication between two devices. This is initiated
by one device sending a message to another device requesting the exchange of data.
Session caching – function in TLS that allows a previous computer session to be
‘remembered’, therefore preventing the need to establish a new link each time a new session is
attempted.
Certificate authority (CA) – commercial organisation used to generate a digital certificate
requested by website owners or individuals.
Public key infrastructure (PKI) – a set of protocols, standards and services that allow users
to authenticate each other using digital certificates issued by a CA.

The two main protocols used to ensure security when using the internet are Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS); these are both part of the transport layer
discussed in Chapter 14.
TLS is the more modern; it is based on SSL. The primary use of SSL and TLS is in the
client/server application (see Chapter 2). They both use the standard cryptographic protocols to
ensure there is a secure and authenticated communication between client and server. However,
normally only the server is authenticated with the client remaining unauthenticated. Once a
secure link between server and client is established, SSL or TLS protocols ensure no third party
can eavesdrop.

17.3.1 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
When a user logs onto a website, SSL encrypts the data – only the client’s computer and the web
server are able to make sense of what is being transmitted. Two other functions of SSL are data
compression (reducing the amount of data being transmitted), and data integrity checks. A user
will know if SSL is being applied when they see the https protocol and/or the small green closed
padlock.
The browser address display is different when the http or https protocol is used:

Figure 17.6

Similar banners will be seen when using TLS.
As mentioned in Chapter 14, TCP is used to establish a connection between the client and the
server. A handshake takes place, thus enabling communication to begin between the client and
server. One part of the SSL protocol is to agree which encryption algorithms are to be used; this
is essential to ensure a secure, encrypted communication takes place. To be able to create an SSL
connection, a web server requires an SSL digital certificate; the website owner needs to obtain
this certificate to allow SSL protocols to be used (see Section 17.4).
Examples of where and when SSL (and TLS) would be used include
• online banking and all online financial transactions
• online shopping/commerce
• sending software to a restricted list of users
• sending and receiving emails
• using cloud storage facilities
• intranets and extranets (as well as the internet)
• using virtual private networks (VPNs)
• using Voice over Internet Protocols (VoIP) for video and/or audio chatting over the internet
• using instant messaging
• making use of a social networking site.

17.3.2 Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a modern, more secure version of SSL – it provides
encryption, authentication and data integrity in a more effective way. It ensures the security and
privacy of data between devices and users when communicating over a network (such as the
internet). When a website and client communicate over the internet, TLS prevents third party
eavesdropping.
TLS is formed of two main layers:
1 Record protocol can be used with or without encryption (it contains the data being
  transmitted over the network/internet).
2 Handshake protocol permits the web server and client to authenticate each other and to make
  use of encryption algorithms (a secure session between client and server is then established).
Only the most recent web browsers support both SSL and TLS, which is why the older, less
secure, SSL is still used in many cases (although soon SSL will not be supported and users will
have to adopt the newer TLS protocol if they wish to access the internet using a browser).
• It is possible to extend TLS by adding new authentication methods (unlike SSL).
• TLS can make use of session caching which improves the overall performance of the
  communication when compared to SSL (see below).
• TLS separates the handshaking process from the record protocol (layer) where all the data is
  held.

Session caching
When opening a TLS session, it requires considerable computer time (due mainly to complex
cryptographic processes taking place). The use of session caching can avoid the need to utilise as
much computer time for each connection. TLS can either establish a new session or attempt to
resume an existing session; using the latter can considerably boost the system performance.

Summary
As already indicated, two of the main functions of SSL/TLS are
• the encryption of data
• the identification of client and server to ensure each knows who they are communicating with.
Stage 1: Once the client types in the URL into the browser and hits the <enter> key, several
steps will occur before any actual encrypted data is sent; this is known as the handshaking stage.
Stage 2: The client’s browser now requests secure pages (https) from the web server.
Stage 3: The web server sends back the SSL digital certificate (which also contains the public
key) – the certificate is digitally signed by a third party called the certificate authority (CA)
(see Section 17.4.2).
Stage 4: Once the client’s browser receives the digital certificate, it checks
  – the digital signature of the CA (is it one of those in the browser’s trusted store – a list of
     trusted CAs is part of the browser which the client downloads to their computer)

  – if the start and end dates shown on the certificate are still valid
  – if the domain listed in the certificate is an exact match with the domain requested by the
     client in the first place.
Stage 5: Once the browser trusts the digital certificate, the public key (which forms part of the
digital certificate) is used by the browser to generate a temporary session key with the web
server; this session key is then sent back to the web server.
Stage 6: The web server uses its private key to decrypt the session key and then sends back an
acknowledgement that is encrypted using the same session key.
Stage 7: The browser and web server can now encrypt all the data/traffic sent over the
connection using this session key; a secure communication can now take place.
The public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of protocols, standards and services that allow
clients and servers to authenticate each other using digital certificates issued by the CA (for
example, X509, PKI X.509); digital signatures also follow the same protocol. PKI requires the
provider to use an encryption algorithm to generate public and private keys.

17.4 Digital signatures and digital certificates
Key terms
Digital signature – electronic way of validating the authenticity of digital documents (that is,
making sure they have not been tampered with during transmission) and also proof that a
document was sent by a known user.
Digest –a fixed-size numeric representation of the contents of a message produced from a
hashing algorithm. This can be encrypted to form a digital signature.
Hashing algorithm (cryptography) – a function which converts a data string into a numeric
string which is used in cryptography.
Digital certificate – an electronic document used to prove the identity of a website or
individual. It contains a public key and information identifying the website owner or
individual, issued by a CA.

17.4.1 Digital signatures
Digital signatures are a way of validating the authenticity of digital documents and identifying
the sender (signing with a digital signature indicates that the original message, document or file
is safe and has not been tampered with). As mentioned earlier on, there are four main purposes of
digital signatures: authentication, non-repudiation, data integrity and confidentiality. A digital
signature is a digital code which is often derived from the digital certificate (described below),
although other methods of generating digital signatures will be described throughout this section.
The example used in Section 17.1 required Meera to send her public key to each of the workers,
and she used her private key to decrypt their messages. However, the two keys can be reversed –
the other workers can encrypt messages using their own private keys and then send these
encrypted messages to other workers in the company, who use their matching public key to
decrypt the messages. While this would be a bad idea if the messages were confidential, it could
be used as a way of identifying or verifying who the sender of the message was (in other words,
the private key would act like a digital signature, identifying the sender, since the private keys
will be unique to the sender).
This also needs a lot of processing time to encrypt everything in the message. The following
method, which is used to identify the sender and ensure the message was not tampered with, does
not encrypt the messages but uses a generated numerical value known as a digest.
With this method, to actually identify the sender, it is not necessary to encrypt the whole
message. The plaintext message is put through a hashing algorithm which produces the digest.
For example, if the first page of this chapter was going to be sent, we could put it through a
hashing algorithm (such as MD4) and it would produce a digest, for example, it might produce
the following digest:
                               873add9ed804fc5ce0338d2e9f7e0962
The sender’s private key and digest are then put through an encryption algorithm to produce a
digital signature.
Therefore, the plaintext and digital signature are sent to the recipient as two separate files. The
recipient puts the digital signature through a decryption algorithm (using the sender’s public key)
to produce a digest. The recipient then puts the plaintext through the same hashing algorithm and
also produces a digest.
If these two digests are the same, then the document has been sent correctly (and has not been
tampered with). Since this process does not encrypt the document, if it needed to be kept
confidential then it would be necessary to put the document through the asymmetric encryption
process, as described earlier, before sending.
Note: a digest is a fixed-size numerical value which represents the content of a message. It is
generated by putting the message through a hashing algorithm. The digest can be encrypted to
produce a digital signature.
Figure 17.7 outlines the process.

Figure 17.7

However, this method still is not safe enough, since the public key could be forged by a third
party, which means the recipient still cannot be certain that the message came from a legitimate
source. Therefore, an even more robust system is needed to give confidence that the sender is
really who they claim to be.

17.4.2 Digital certificates
A digital certificate is an electronic ‘document’ used to prove the online identity of a website or
an individual. The certificate contains a public key and other information identifying the owner
of the certificate. A digital certificate is issued by the certificate authority (CA) – they
independently validate the identity of the certificate owner.
This is a list of the items commonly found on a digital certificate
• version number
• serial number of certificate
• algorithm identification
• name of certificate issuer
• validity (start date and expiry date of certificate)
• company details
• public key
• issuer’s identifier
• company’s identifier
• signature algorithm used
• digital signature.

The digital signature is created by condensing all of the certificate details and then putting it
through a hashing algorithm (such as MD4/5). The number generated is then put through an
encryption algorithm, together with the CA’s private key, thus producing a digital signature.

Figure 17.8 shows how a user can apply for a digital certificate. Figure 17.9 shows what a typical
SSL digital certificate looks like.

Figure 17.8

Figure 17.9

It is possible for a user to produce a self-signed digital certificate rather than use a commercial
CA (for example, if an individual builds their own website, called my-site.com, and wants to
make this generally available on the internet, they could produce their own digital certificate).
However, if a user attempts to log onto my-site.com they might see an error screen, like this:

 sequence statement
            the sender and receiver are now fully synchronised
            the photons are sent through four random polarisers which give one of four
            possible polarisations and bit values
            the process is repeated until the whole of the encryption key has been transmitted

 1           the sender uses a light source to create the photons
             one of the two beam splitters is chosen at random and the photon detectors are
             read
             the sender now informs the recipient where, in the sequence, the correct beam
             splitters had been used
             the polarised photons travel along the fibre optic cable to the destination

             would find it impossible to crack the key code
             the sender now compares this sequence to the polarisation sequence used by the
             sending station
             at the destination, there are two beam splitters (diagonal and vertical/ horizontal)
             and two photon detectors
             the recipient sends back the sequence of beam splitters to the sender

2 a) Explain the terms SSL and TLS.
                                                                                                [3]
  b) Explain the following terms used in TLS.
     i) Record protocol
     ii) Handshake protocol
     iii) Session caching
                                                                                                [5]
  c) Give two differences between SSL and TLS.
                                                                                                [2]
3 A user keys a URL into their browser and hits the <enter> key.
  Re-order the following stages, 1-6, to show how an SSL digital certificate is used to set up a
  secure connection between client (user) and website.
                                                                                              [6]

 order stage
         browser and web server now encrypt all data/traffic sent over the connection using
         the session key and a secure communication can now take place
         client’s browser requests secure pages (https) from the web server
         once trusted, the browser uses public key to agree temporary session key with web
         server; session key is sent back to web server
         the web server uses its private key to decrypt the session key and then sends back an
         acknowledgement that is encrypted using the session key
         once the client’s browser gets the SSL digital certificate it checks the digital

       signature, validity of start and end dates and whether the domain listed in the
       certificate matches the domain requested by the user
       the web server sends back the SSL digital certificate containing the public key; this
       is digitally signed by a third party called the Certificate Authority (CA)

b) List four items found on a digital certificate.
                                                                                               [4]
c) Explain how a digital signature can be formed from a digital certificate.
                                                                                               [2]

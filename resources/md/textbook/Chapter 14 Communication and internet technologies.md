14.1.1 The need for protocols
When communicating over networks, it is essential that some form of protocol is used by the
sender and receiver of the data. Both parties need to agree the protocol being used to ensure
successful communication takes place. In Chapter 6, we discussed parity checking as a way of
determining whether data was transmitted correctly. With this method, it was essential to agree
the protocol: even or odd parity. Without agreeing this protocol, it would be impossible to use
parity checking. Many different protocols exist since there are several activities taking place over
the internet.
The next section considers one of the most common sets of protocols, which are implemented by
using a stack structure with several layers.

14.1.2 TCP/IP protocols
This is the four-layer structure for TCP/IP protocols:

Figure 14.1 Four layer structure for TCP/IP

Using layers breaks the process down into manageable self-contained modules (this process is
known as decomposition), making it easier to develop and easier to make software and hardware
compatible.
When sending data across the internet (network), the layers are used in the order layer 4 to layer
1; when receiving data across the internet (network), the layers are used in the order layer 1 to
layer 4. Each of the layers is implemented using software.

Application layer
The application layer contains all the programs that exchange data, such as web browsers or
server software; it sends files to the transport layer. This layer allows applications to access the
services used in other layers and also defines the protocols that any app uses to allow the
exchange of data.
There are several protocols associated with the application layer:

 HTTP         hypertext transfer protocol; this is a protocol responsible for correct transfer of files
              that make up web pages on the world wide web
 SMTP         simple mail transfer protocol; this handles the sending of emails
 POP3/4 post office protocol; this handles the receiving of emails
 IMAP         internet message access protocol; this handles the receiving of emails
 DNS          domain name service; protocol used to find the IP address, for example, when
              sending emails
 FTP          file transfer protocol; this is a protocol used when transferring messages and
              attachments
 RIP          routing information protocol; this is the protocol routers use to exchange routing
              information over an IP network
 SNMP         simple network management protocol; protocol used when exchanging network

               management information between network management and network devices (such
               as routers, servers and other network devices)
Table 14.1 Protocols associated with the application layer

It is worth re-visiting the terms packet and router.
Messages are split up into small groups of bits called packets (for example, a web page would be
split up into a number of packets before sending over the network).
A router is used to transmit packets of data; routers contain connections to many other routers;
when packets arrive at a router it decides where next to send them.

Important terminology: packets are known as frames at the data-link layer, datagrams at the
internet layer and segments at the transport layer. Different names are used as each layer adds
its own header to the packet.
Do not confuse ‘frames’ in this context with ‘frames’ when discussing paging memory
management in Chapter 16.

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is probably the most important application layer protocol. Essentially, this protocol
underpins the world wide web. It is used when, for example, fetching an HTML document from
a web server (Figure 14.2).

Figure 14.2 Fetching an HTML document from a web server

This makes use of hyperlinks (rules for the transferring of data over the internet). HTTP is a
client/server protocol: request messages are sent out to the web servers which then respond.
HTTP protocols define the format of the messages sent and received. The web browser (which is
part of the application layer) initiates the web page request and also converts HTML into a

format which can be displayed on the user’s screen or can be played through their media player.
The following summarises what happens when a user requests a web page from a website.
• The user keys the URL into their browser.
• HTTP(s) transmits the request from the application layer to the transport layer (TCP).
• The TCP creates data packets and sends them (via port 80) to the destination port(s).
• The DNS server stores a database of URLs and matching IP addresses.
• The DNS server uses the domain name typed into the browser to look up the IP address of
  the appropriate website.
• The server TCP sends back an acknowledgement (see the section on host-to-host
  communication on page 333).
• Once communication has been established, the web server sends the web page back in
  HTML format to the browser.
• The browser interprets the page and displays it or sends the data in the correct format to the
  media player.

File transfer protocol (FTP)
The FTP file transfer protocol (FTP) is a network protocol used when transferring files from
one computer/device to another via the internet or other networks. It is similar to HTTP and
SMTP, but FTP’s only task is the application protocol for the transfer of files over a network.
Web browsers can be used to connect to an FTP address in a way similar to HTTP, for example,
ftp://username@ftp.example.gov/
Additional features of FTP include
• anonymous ftp – this allows a user to access files without the need to identify who they are to
  the ftp server; for example, ‘331 Anonymous access allowed’ would be a message received to
  confirm anonymous access
• ftp commands – a user is able to carry out actions that can change files stored on the ftp
  server; for example, delete, close, rename, cd (change directory on a remote machine), lcd
  (change directory on a local machine)
• ftp server – this is where the files, which can be downloaded as required by a user, are stored.
A session would be started by typing in the ftp host_name (of remote system), followed by a user
id and password. The user would then be able to use ftp commands to carry out a number of
actions.
Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)
Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is a text-based (and connection-based) protocol used
when sending emails. It is sometimes referred to as a push protocol (in other words, a client
opens a connection to a server and keeps the connection active all the time; the client then
uploads a new email to the server).
Since SMTP is text-based only, it doesn’t handle binary files (a binary file is a file containing
media/images as well as text and is regarded as being computer-readable only). If an email
contains attachments made up of, for example, images, video, music then it is necessary to use

the multi-purpose internet mail extension (MIME) protocol instead. A MIME header is used
at the beginning of the transmission; clients use this header to select which media player is
needed when the attachment is opened.
POP3/4 and IMAP (post office protocol and internet message access protocol)
POP Post office protocol (POP3/4) and internet message access protocol (IMAP) are
protocols used when receiving emails from the email server. These are known as pull protocols
(the client periodically connects to a server; checks for and downloads new emails from the
server – the connection is then closed; this process is repeated to ensure the client is updated).
IMAP is a more a recent protocol than POP3/4, but both have really been superseded by the
increasing use of HTTP protocols. However, SMTP is still used when transferring emails
between email servers.
Figures 14.3 and 14.4 give an overall view and a more detailed view of the email protocol set up.

Figure 14.3 Overview of email protocol set up

Figure 14.4 Detailed view of email protocol set up

The main difference between POP3/4 and IMAP is synchronisation:

 POP3/4                                              IMAP
 POP3/4 does not keep the server and client in       IMAP keeps the server and client in
 synchronisation; when emails are downloaded         synchronisation; only a copy of the email is
 by the client, they are then deleted from the       downloaded with the original remaining on
 server which means it is not further updated.       the server until the client manually deletes
                                                     it.

Table 14.2

Transport layer
The transport layer regulates the network connections; this is where data is broken up into
packets which are then sent to the internet/network layer (IP protocol). The transport layer
ensures that packets arrive in sequence, without errors, by swapping acknowledgements and
retransmitting packets if they become lost or corrupted. The main protocols associated with the
transport layer are transmission control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP) and
SCTP. We will only consider TCP.
Transmission control protocol (TCP)
TCP is responsible for the safe delivery of a message by creating sufficient packets for
transmission. It uses positive acknowledgement with re-transmission (PAR) which means it
automatically re-sends a data packet if it has not received a positive acknowledgement. TCP is
also connection-orientated since it establishes an end-to-end connection between two host
computers using handshakes. For this last reason, TCP is often referred to as a host-to-host
transmission protocol.
The term host has been used previously; this refers to a computer or device that can
communicate with another computer/device (host). Hosts can include clients and servers that
send/receive data, provide services or apps.
These are the steps taken when host computer ‘X’ communicates with another host ‘Y’ (this is an
expansion of what happens during TCP involvement shown in the HTTP algorithm earlier on):
• Host ‘X’ will first of all send host ‘Y’ a segment (packet) which will include synchronisation
  sequence bits so that segments will be received in the correct order.
• Host ‘Y’ will now respond by sending back its own segment (containing an acknowledgement
  together with its own synchronisation sequence bits).
• Host ‘X’ now sends out its own acknowledgement that the segment from ‘Y’ was received.
• Transmission of data between ‘X’ and ‘Y’ can now take place.

Internet/network layer and network/data-link layer
The internet layer identifies the intended network and host. The common protocol is IP (internet
protocol). The concept of IPv4 and IPv6 was covered in depth in Chapter 2.
The network/data-link layer identifies and moves traffic across local segments, encapsulates IP
packets into frames for transmission, maps IP addresses to MAC (physical) addresses and
ensures correct protocols are followed. The physical network layer specifies requirements of the
hardware to be used for the network. The data-link layer identifies network protocols in the
packet header (TCP/IP in the case here) and delivers packets to the network.
This is a summary of the IP functions:
• Ensure correct routing of packets of data over the internet/network.
• Responsible for protocols when communicating between networks.
• Take a packet from the transport layer and add its own header which will include the IP
  addresses of both sender and recipient.
• The IP packet (datagram) is sent to the data-link layer where it is assembles the datagrams into

  frames for transmission.
Ethernet protocols
Ethernet is a system that connects a number of computers or devices together to form a LAN. It
uses protocols to control the movement of frames between computers or devices and to avoid
simultaneous transmission by two or more devices. It is a local protocol and does not provide
any means to communicate with external devices; this requires the use of IP which sits on top of
the Ethernet protocol.
Figure 14.5 shows the make-up of a typical frame used by the Ethernet protocol.

Figure 14.5 A typical frame used by the Ethernet protocol

If VLAN is used, the Ethernet data size increases from 1539 bytes to around 9000 bytes per
frame.
The components that make up Ethernet data are
• destination – this is the MAC address of the destination computer or device (it is possible to
  use the value FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF as the MAC address if the sender wishes to target every
  device (for example, to advertise services) or if they do not know the MAC address of the
  destination device)
• source – this is the MAC address of the source computer (using the usual MAC address format
  of 6 bytes)
• Ethernet type or length – if the frame length ≤ 1539 then the value here is the length of the
  Ethernet frame; if the frame length > 1539 then the value here is the Ethernet type (IPv4 or
  IPv6 in our example)
• frame check – this will include a checksum to provide a method of checking data integrity
  following transmission of the frame.
Wireless (WiFi) protocols
Wireless LANs (standard IEEE 802.11 protocol) use a MAC protocol called carrier sense
multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) (not to be confused with CSMA/CD
considered in Chapter 2, since this is a totally different concept).
CSMA/CA uses distributed control function (DCF) to ensure a WiFi device can only transmit
when there is a free channel available. Since all transmissions are acknowledged when using
DCF, if a device does not receive an acknowledgement it will assume a collision will occur and
waits for a random time interval before trying again. This is an important protocol to ensure the
security and integrity of data being sent over a wireless network (such as WLAN).
Bluetooth protocols

Bluetooth was considered in Chapter 2; it uses the standard IEEE 802.15 protocol for short-range
data transmission/communication. There are numerous additional Bluetooth protocols due to the
many applications that may use this wireless connectivity; this is outside the scope of this
textbook.
WiMax
Worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMax) runs under IEEE 802.16 protocol.
This connectivity was designed originally for wireless MANs (WMAN). Fixed WiMax networks
are based on the IEEE 802.16-2004 protocol, whereas mobile WiMax is based on IEEE 802.16-
2005 protocol.
Peer-to-peer file sharing/BitTorrent protocol
The BitTorrent is a protocol which is based on the peer-to-peer networking concept (this was
covered in Chapter 2). This allows for very fast sharing of files between computers (known as
peers). While peer-to-peer networks only work well with very small numbers of computers, the
concept of sharing files using BitTorrent can be used by thousands of users who connect together
over the internet. Because user computers are sharing files directly with each other (rather than
using a web server) they are sharing files in a way similar to that used in a peer-to-peer network;
the main difference is that the BitTorrent protocol allows many computers (acting as peers) to
share files.
Suppose computer ‘A’ wishes to share a file with a number of other interested peers. How can
we use the BitTorrent protocol to allow this file sharing?
Initially, to share a file, the peer (computer ‘A’) creates a small file called a torrent (for example,
MyVideoFile.torrent). The torrent contains metadata about the file about to be shared.
The actual file is broken up into equal segments known as pieces (typically a 20 MiB file may be
broken up into 20 × 1 MiB pieces).
Other peers who wish to download this file must first obtain the torrent and connect to the
appropriate tracker – a central server that contains data about all of the computers connected to
it.
As each peer receives a piece of file they then become a source for that piece of file. Other peers
connected to the tracker will, therefore, know where to find the piece of file they need.
Once a peer has downloaded a file completely and they make the file (or required pieces of the
file) available to other peers in the swarm (a group of peers connected together), they become a
seed. The more seeds in the swarm, the faster the file downloading process between peers.
Logging off once the full file download has been completed is frowned upon by the swarm
community; such a peer is termed a leech.
Usually, once a file is fully downloaded, a peer is requested to remain online so they can become
part of the seeding process until all peers have received the whole file. Note that file pieces may
not be downloaded sequentially and have to be rearranged in the correct order by the BitTorrent
protocol to produce the final file (quite important if the file is a video!).
At the time of writing, BitTorrent was responsible for about 12% of the video file sharing, for
example, being carried out over the internet. This is only a fraction of the video file activity

which uses YouTube (which is about 50% of all of the video file sharing over the internet), but is
still a considerable amount of data.
Here is a summary of some of the terms used when discussing BitTorrent:
• Swarm – a group of peers connected together is known as a swarm; one of the most important
  facts when considering whether or not a swarm can continue to allow peers to complete a
  torrent is its availability; availability refers to the number of complete copies of torrent
  contents that are distributed amongst a swarm. Note: a torrent is simply the name given to a
  file being shared on the peer-to-peer network.
• Seed – a peer that has downloaded a file (or pieces of a file) and has then made it available to
  other peers in the swarm.
• Tracker – this is a central server that stores details about other computers that make up the
  swarm; it will store details about all the peers downloading or uploading the file, allowing the
  peers to locate each other using the stored IP addresses.
• Leech – a peer that has a negative impact on the swarm by having a poor share ratio, that is,
  they are downloading much more data than they are uploading to the others; the ratio is
  determined using the formula:

  If the ratio > 1 then the peer has a positive impact on the swarm; if the ratio < 1 then the peer
  has a negative effect on the swarm.
• Lurker – a peer that downloads many files but does not make available any new content for
  the community as a whole.
In Figure 14.6, we will assume 12 peers have connected to the tracker. One peer has begun to
upload a video file and six peers are acting as seeds. Two peers are behaving as leeches and three
peers have just joined and have requested a download of the video file. The arrangement would
look something like this:

Figure 14.6 The arrangement of peers during the download and upload of file (pieces)

14.2 Circuit switching and packet switching
WHAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW
In Chapter 2, you learnt about communications. Try these two questions before you read the
second part of this chapter.
1 a) Explain how PSTN is used when making a phone call.
   b) Explain how it is possible to use VoIP to make a video call over the internet.
2 Draw a diagram to show how a message containing three packets of data could be routed
   from computer ‘A’ to computer ‘B’.

Key terms
Circuit switching – method of transmission in which a dedicated circuit/channel lasts
throughout the duration of the communication.
Packet switching – method of transmission where a message is broken into packets which can
be sent along paths independently from each other.
Hop number/hopping – number in the packet header used to stop packets which never reach
their destination from ‘clogging up’ routes.
Header (data packet) – part of a data packet containing key data such as destination IP
address, sequence number, and so on.
Routing table – a data table that contains the information necessary to forward a package
along the shortest or best route to allow it to reach its destination.

14.2.1 Circuit switching
The concept of circuit switching was introduced in Chapter 2 during the description of how a
public switched telephone network (PSTN) was used to make a phone call. Circuit switching
uses a dedicated channel/circuit which lasts throughout the connection: the communication line
is effectively ‘tied up’. When sending data across a network, there are three stages:
1 First, a circuit/channel between sender and receiver must be established.
2 Data transfer then takes place (which can be analogue or digital); transmission is usually bi-
   directional.
3 After the data transfer is complete, the connection is terminated.
The pros and cons of circuit switching are summarised in this table. Figure 14.7 shows an
example of circuit switching.

 Pros                                             Cons
 the circuit used is dedicated to the single      it is not very flexible (for example, it will send
 transmission only                                empty frames and it has to use a single,
                                                  dedicated line)
 the whole of the bandwidth is available          nobody else can use the circuit/channel even
                                                  when it is idle
 the data transfer rate is faster than with       the circuit is always there whether or not it is
 packet switching                                 used
 the packets of data (frames) arrive at the       if there is a failure/fault on the dedicated line,
 destination in the same order as they were       there is no alternative routing available
 sent
 a packet of data cannot get lost since all       dedicated channels require a greater bandwidth
 packets follow on in sequence along the
 same single route
 it works better than packet switching in real-   prior to actual transmission, the time required
 time applications                                to establish a link can be long
Table 14.3 Pros and cons of circuit switching

Figure 14.7 An example of circuit switching

The dedicated route from ‘A’ to ‘B’ is first of all established (shown in orange on the diagram).
The following connections are then partially implemented: A–R2, R2–R5, R5–R8, R8–R7, R7–
R10 and finally R10–B. All packets (frames) follow this single route and communication will
take place, provided ‘B’ is not busy.
The main uses of circuit switching include public telephone networks, private telephone
networks and private data networks.

14.2.2 Packet switching
Packet switching was introduced in Chapter 2 when describing VoIP, together with a diagram to
show how the individual packets are routed from client to client.
Packet switching is a method of transmission in which a message is broken up into a number of
packets that can be sent independently to each other from start point to end point. The data
packets will need to be reassembled into their correct order at the destination. Figure 14.8 shows
an example of packet switching.
Note that
• each packet follows its own path
• routing selection depends on the number of datagram packets waiting to be processed at each
  node (router)
• the shortest path available is selected
• packets can reach the destination in a different order to that in which they are sent.

Figure 14.8 An example of packet switching

As Figure 14.8 shows, the message sent by computer ‘A’ was split into four packets. The
original packet order was:       and they arrived in the order:    which means they need to
be reassembled in the correct order at the destination.
The pros and cons of packet switching are summarised in this table.

 Pros                                                          Cons
 no need to tie up a communication line                        the protocols for packet
                                                               switching can be more complex
                                                               than those for circuit switching
 it is possible to overcome failed or faulty lines by simply   if a packet is lost, the sender
 re-routing packages                                           must re-send the packet (which
                                                               wastes time)
 it is easy to expand the traffic usage                        does not work well with real-
                                                               time data streams

 circuit switching charges the user on the distance and           the circuit/channel has to share
 duration of a connection, but packet switching charges           its bandwidth with other packets
 users only for the duration of the connectivity
 high data transmission is possible with packet switching         there is a delay at the destination
                                                                  while packets are reassembled
 packet switching always uses digital networks which              needs large amounts of RAM to
 means digital data is transmitted directly to the destination    handle the large amounts of data

Sometimes it is possible for packets to get lost and keep ‘bouncing’ around from router to router
and never actually get to their destination. Eventually, the network could grind to a halt as the
number of ‘lost’ packets mounts up and clogs up the system. To overcome this, a method called
hopping is used. A hop number is added to the header of each packet. Each packet is only
allowed to hop a finite number of times (this number is determined by the network protocol and
routing table being used). Each time a packet passes through a router, the hop number is
decreased by 1. If the packet has not reached its destination and the hop number = 0, then it will
be deleted when it reaches the next router.
Each packet also contains an error checking technique such as a checksum or parity check. If a
checksum is used, this value is calculated for each packet and is added to the header. The
checksum for each package is recalculated at the destination to ensure no errors have occurred. If
the checksum values are different, then a request is made to re-send the packet. A priority value
is sometimes also added to a header. A high priority value indicates which packet queue should
be used.
This is the make-up of a packet header (together with the data in the message being sent) if
TCP/IP protocol is being used when sending packets:

Figure 14.9

More generally, packet headers contain the following information (the information used with
TCP/IP protocol headers is highlighted in green)
• 4 bits to identify protocol version (such as IPv4, IPv6 – in the example above we assume IP)
• 4 bits to identify header length (in multiples of four; for example, a value of six implies 6 × 4 =
  24 bytes)
• 8 bits to represent packet priority
• 16 bits to identify the length of the packet in bytes
• 3 bits are used for fragmentation; the DF flag indicates whether a packet can be fragmented or
  not (DF = do not fragment) and the MF flag indicates whether there are more fragments of a
  packet to follow (MF = more fragments)

              0                          DF                                    MF

• 13 bits to show fragmentation offset to identify the position of the fragments within the
  original packet
• 8 bits that show the current hop number of the packet
• 16 bits to show the number of packets in the message
• 16 bits to represent the sequence number of the packet
• 8 bits that contain the transmission protocol being used (TCP, UDP)
• 16 bits that contain the header checksum value
• 32 bits that contain the source IP address
• 32 bits that contain the destination IP address.

Routing tables
Routing tables contain the information necessary to forward a package along the shortest/best
route to allow it to reach its destination. As soon as the packet reaches a router, the packet header
is examined and compared with the routing table. The table supplies the router with instructions
to send the packet (hop) to the next available router.
Routing tables include
• number of hops
• MAC address of the next router where the packet is to be forwarded to (hopped)
• metrics (a cost is assigned to each available route so that the most efficient route/path is found)
• network destination (network ID) or pathway
• gateway (the same information as the next hop; it points to the gateway through which target
  network can be reached)
• netmask (used to generate network ID)

• interface (indicates which locally available interface is responsible for reaching the gateway).

Example 14.1
Suppose we are carrying out video conferencing using packet switching as the method of
routing data. The performance of the communication is not very good.
a) Describe some of the poor performance you might expect.
  Give a reason for this poor performance.
b) What features of circuit switching could potentially improve the performance?

 Solution
 a) Answers might include: picture and sound may not be in synchronisation (packets arriving
   at different times); video not continuous – pauses (time delay in reassembling the packets
   of data); degraded quality of sound and video (possibly caused by competing traffic in
   communication lines); possible drop out (packets take different routes, so it is possible for
   packets to be lost).
 b) Answers might include: only one route used in circuit switching; therefore, all packets
   arrive in correct order; dedicated communication channel with circuit switching; therefore,
   full bandwidth available; there is no loss of synchronisation with circuit switching.

Example 14.2
How would packet switching be used to download a page from a website?

Solution
Answers might include
• the web page is divided up into data packets
• each packet has a header, which includes the IP address of the destination
• the router checks the header against values stored in the routing table …
• … to determine which router the packet needs to be sent to next (hopped) …
• … the MAC address of the next router is added to the package header
• the hop value is checked to see if it equals zero
• each packet may go by a different route
• the destination computer reassembles the packets building up the final web page.

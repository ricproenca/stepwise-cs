3.1.1 Types of memory and storage
Computers require some form of memory and storage.
Memory is usually referred to as the internal devices which the computer can access directly.
This memory can be the user’s workspace, temporary data or data that is key to running the
computer.
Storage devices allow users to store applications, data and files. The user’s data is stored
permanently and they can change it or read it as they wish. Storage needs to be larger than
internal memory since the user may wish to store large files (such as music files or photographic
images).
Storage devices can also be removable to allow data, for example, to be transferred between
computers. Removable devices allow a user to store important data in a different building in case
of data loss.
However, all of this has become a lot less important with the advent of technology such as ‘data
drop’ (which uses Bluetooth) and cloud storage.
Internal memory includes components such as registers (which are part of the processor). There
is also memory cache (which is external to the processor); this is used to store data which the
processor will probably need to use again.
Figure 3.2 summarises the types of memory and storage devices covered in this chapter.

Figure 3.2 Memory and storage devices

Primary memory
Primary memory is the part of computer memory which can be accessed directly from the CPU
and, as Figure 3.2 shows, contains the random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory
(ROM) memory chips. Primary memory allows the processor to access applications and services
temporarily stored in memory locations. The structure of primary memory is shown in Figure
3.3.

Figure 3.3 Structure of primary memory

All computer systems come with some form of RAM. These memory devices are not really
random, it refers to the fact that any memory location can be accessed independent of which
memory location was last used. Access time to locate data is much faster in RAM than in
secondary devices. RAM can also be
• written to or read from, and the data stored can be changed by the user or by the computer
• used to store data, files, part of an application or part of the operating system currently in use
• volatile (memory contents are lost on powering off the computer).
In general, the larger the RAM, the faster the computer will operate. In reality, RAM never runs
out of memory, it continues to operate but just becomes slower and slower as more data is stored.
As RAM becomes ‘full’, the processor has to continually access the secondary data storage
devices to overwrite old data on RAM with new data. By increasing the RAM size, the number
of times this has to be done is considerably reduced, thus making the computer operate more
quickly.
There are currently two types of RAM technology, dynamic RAM (DRAM) and static RAM
(SRAM).
Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
Each DRAM chip consists of a number of transistors and capacitors. Each of these parts is tiny
since a single RAM chip will contain millions of capacitors and transistors.

Figure 3.4 Two pieces of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)

• Capacitors hold the bits of information (0 or 1).
• Transistors act like switches; they allow the chip control circuitry to read the capacitor or
  change the capacitor’s value.
This type of RAM needs to be constantly refreshed (that is, the capacitor needs to be re-charged
every 15 microseconds otherwise it would lose its value). If it is not refreshed, the capacitor’s
charge will leak away very quickly, leaving every capacitor with the value 0.

DRAMs have a number of advantages over SRAMs. They:
• are much less expensive to manufacture than SRAMs
• consume less power than SRAMs
• have a higher memory capacity than SRAMs.
Static RAM (SRAM)
A major difference between SRAM and DRAM is that SRAM does not need to be constantly
refreshed.
It makes use of flip flops (see Chapter 15) which hold each bit of memory.
SRAM is much faster than DRAM when it comes to data access (typically, access time for
SRAM is 25 nanoseconds and for DRAM is 60 nanoseconds).
DRAM is the most common type of RAM used in computers, but where absolute speed is
essential, for example in the processor’s memory cache, SRAM is the preferred technology.
Memory cache is a high speed portion of the memory. It is effective because most programs
access the same data or instructions many times. By keeping as much of this information as
possible in SRAM, the computer avoids having to access the slower DRAM.

Figure 3.5 Static RAM

Table 3.1 summarises the differences between DRAM and SRAM.

   levels of access, as it needs to be constantly          • processor memory cache makes

                                                             power usage can exceed that of
                                                             DRAM

Table 3.1 Differences between DRAM and SRAM

Another form of primary memory is the read-only memory (ROM). This is similar to RAM in
that it shares the same random access properties, but it cannot be written to or changed. As the
name suggests, ROM is a read-only memory device.

ROMs are
• non-volatile (the contents are not lost after powering off the computer)
• permanent memory devices (the contents cannot be changed)
• often used to store data which the computer needs to access when powering up for the first
  time for example, the basic input/output system (BIOS).
Table 3.2 summarises the main differences between RAM and ROM.

 • can be written to and read from                    • data stored cannot be altered
 • used to store data, files, programs, part of OS    • sometimes used to store BIOS and other
   currently in use                                     data needed at start up
 • can be increased in size to improve
   operational speed of a computer

Table 3.2 Differences between RAM and ROM

PROM and EPROM
A programmable read-only memory (PROM) is a type of ROM chip that can be altered once.
A PROM is made up of a matrix of fuses. Programming a PROM requires the use of a PROM
writer which uses an electric current to alter specific cells by ‘burning’ fuses in the matrix. Due
to the method of programming (writing), a PROM can only be written to once. They are often
used in mobile phones and in RFID tags.
An erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) is different to a PROM because
they use floating gate transistors and capacitors rather than fuses. Ultra violet (UV) light is used
to program an EPROM through a quartz window. They are used in applications which are under
development, such as the programming of new games consoles.
Embedded systems
Embedded systems involve installing microprocessors into devices to enable operations to be
controlled in a more efficient way. Devices such as cookers, refrigerators and central heating
systems can now all be activated by a web-enabled device (such as a mobile phone or tablet).
The time a central heating system switches on or off and the temperature can all be set from an
app on a mobile phone from anywhere in the world.
There are pros and cons of devices being controlled in this manner, as shown in Table 3.3.

 Pros of embedded systems                   Cons of embedded systems

 • small in size and therefore easy to      • difficult to upgrade devices to take advantage of new
   fit into devices                           technology
 • relatively low cost to make              • troubleshooting faults in the device becomes a

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 3A
Describe how ROM and RAM chips could be used in:
a) a microwave oven
b) a refrigerator
c) a remote-controlled model aeroplane (the movement of the aeroplane is controlled by a
   hand-held device).

Secondary storage devices
Secondary storage includes storage devices that are not directly accessible by the CPU. They are
non-volatile devices which allow data to be stored as long as required by the user. This type of
storage is much larger than primary memory, but data access time is considerably slower than
RAM and ROM. All applications, the operating system, device drivers and general files (for
example, documents, photos and music) are stored on secondary storage. The following section
discusses the various types of secondary storage that can be found on the majority of computers.
Secondary storage devices fall into three categories: magnetic, solid state and optical.
Hard disk drives (HDD)
Hard disk drives (HDD) are still one of the most common methods used to store data on a
computer.
Data is stored in a digital format on the magnetic surfaces of the disks (or platters, as they are
frequently called). The hard disk drive will have a number of platters which can spin at about
7000 times a second. A number of read-write heads can access all of the surfaces in the disk
drive. Normally each platter will have two surfaces which can be used to store the data. These
read-write heads can move very quickly – typically they can move from the centre of the disk to
the edge of the disk (and back again) 50 times a second.
Data is stored on the surface in sectors and tracks.
A sector on a given track will contain a fixed number of bytes.
Unfortunately, hard disk drives have very slow data access when compared to, for example,
RAM. Many applications require the read-write heads to constantly seek for the correct blocks of
data; this means a large number of head movements. The effects of latency then become very

significant. Latency is defined as the time it takes for a specific block of data on a data track to
rotate around to the read-write head.

Figure 3.6 Tracks and sectors on a hard disk drive

Users will sometimes notice the effect of latency when they see messages such as, ‘Please wait’
or, at its worst, ‘not responding’.
When a file or data is stored on an HDD, the required number of sectors needed to store the data
will be allocated. However, the sectors allocated may not be adjacent to each other. Through
time, the HDD will undergo numerous deletions and editing, which leads to sectors becoming
increasingly fragmented, resulting in a gradual deterioration of the HDD performance (in other
words, it takes longer and longer to access data). Defragmentation software can improve on this
situation by ‘tidying up’ the disk sectors.
An HDD is a direct access device; however, data in a given sector will be read sequentially.
Removable hard disk drives are essentially HDDs that are external to the computer and can be
connected to the computer using one of the USB ports. In this way, they can be used as back-up
devices or as another way of transferring files between computers.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 3B
The length of a track on each disk in an HDD disk pack becomes much shorter towards the
centre of the disk. Find out how manufacturers have overcome this issue with regards to disk
data capacity and data access time.

Solid state drives (SSD)
Latency is an issue in HDDs, as discussed earlier. Solid state drives (SSD) reduce this issue
considerably. They have no moving parts and all data is retrieved at the same rate. They do not
rely on magnetic properties. The most common type of solid state storage devices store data by
controlling the movement of electrons within NAND chips. The data is stored as 0s and 1s in
millions of tiny transistors (at each junction one transistor is called a floating gate and the other
is called a control gate) within the chip. This effectively produces a non-volatile rewritable
memory.
However, a number of solid state storage devices sometimes use electronically erasable PROM
(EEPROM) technology. The main difference is the use of NOR chips rather than NAND. This
makes them faster in operation but devices using EEPROM are considerably more expensive
than those that use NAND technology. EEPROM also allows data to be read or erased in single

bytes at a time. Use of NAND only allows blocks of data to be read or erased. This makes
EEPROM technology more useful in certain applications where data needs to be accessed or
erased in byte-size chunks.
Because of the cost implications, the majority of solid state storage devices use NAND
technology. The two are usually distinguished by the terms flash memory (use NAND) and
EEPROM (use NOR).
So, what are the main benefits of using an SSD rather than an HDD?
Solid state drives
• are more reliable (no moving parts to go wrong)
• are considerably lighter (which makes them suitable for laptops)
• do not have to ‘get up to speed’ before they work properly
• have a lower power consumption
• run much cooler than HDDs (both these points again make them very suitable for laptop
  computers)
• are very thin (because they have no moving parts)
• access data considerably faster.
The main drawback of SSD is the still unknown longevity of the technology. Most solid state
storage devices are conservatively rated at only 20 GB write operations per day over a three year
period – this is known as SSD endurance. For this reason, SSD technology is not commonly used
in servers, for example, where a huge number of write operations take place every day. However,
this issue is being addressed by a number of manufacturers to improve the durability of these
solid state systems and they are rapidly becoming more common in applications such as servers
and cloud storage devices.
Note that it is also not possible to over-write existing data on a flash memory device; it is
necessary to first erase the old data and then write the new data at the same location.
Memory sticks/flash memories (also known as pen drives) use solid state technology. They
usually connect to the computer through the USB port. Their main advantage is that they are
very small, lightweight devices which make them suitable for transferring files between
computers. They can also be used as small back-up devices for music or photo files, for example.
Complex or expensive software, such as an expert system, will often use a memory stick as a
dongle. The dongle contains additional files which are needed to run the software. Without this
dongle, the software will not work properly. It therefore prevents illegal or unauthorised use of
the software, and also prevents copying of the software since, without the dongle, it is useless.
Optical media: CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs
CDs and DVDS are described as optical storage devices. Laser light is used to read data from,
and write data onto, the surface of a disk.
Both CDs and DVDs use a thin layer of metal alloy or light-sensitive organic dye to store the
data. As shown in Figure 3.7, both systems use a single, spiral track which runs from the centre
of the disk to the edge. When a disk spins, the optical head moves to the point where the laser
beam ‘contacts’ the disk surface and follows the spiral track from the centre outwards. As with
an HDD, a CD/DVD is divided into sectors allowing direct access of data. Also, as in the case of

an HDD, the outer part of the disk runs faster than the inner part of the disk.

Figure 3.7 CDs and DVDs use a single, spiral track

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 3C
The outer part of an optical disk runs faster than the inner part of the disk. Find out how
manufacturers have overcome this issue with regards to disk data capacity and data access
time.

The data is stored in ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ on the spiral track. A red laser is used to read and write
the data. CDs and DVDs can be designated R (write once only) or RW (can be written to or read
from many times).
DVD technology is slightly different to that used in CDs. One of the main differences is the use
of dual layering which considerably increases the storage capacity. This means that there are
two individual recording layers. Two layers of a standard DVD are joined together with a
transparent (polycarbonate) spacer, and a very thin reflector is sandwiched between the two
layers. Reading and writing of the second layer is done by a red laser focusing at a fraction of a
millimetre difference compared to the first layer.

Figure 3.8 Dual layering in a DVD

Standard, single layer DVDs still have a larger storage capacity than CDs because the ‘pit’ size
and track width are both smaller. This means that more data can be stored on the DVD surface.
DVDs use lasers with a wavelength of 650 nanometres; CDs use lasers with a wavelength of 780
nanometres. The shorter the wavelength of the laser light, the greater the storage capacity of the
medium.

• Blu-ray discs are another example of optical storage media. However, they are fundamentally
  different to DVDs in their construction and in the way they carry out read-write operations.
• Blu-ray uses a blue laser, rather than a red laser, to carry out read and write operations; the
  wavelength of blue light is only 405 nanometres (compared to 650 nm for red light).
• Using blue laser light means that the ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ can be much smaller; consequently, a
  Blu-ray can store up to five times more data than a DVD.
• Blu-ray uses a single 1.1 mm thick polycarbonate disk; DVDs use a sandwich of two 0.6 mm
  thick disks.
• Using two sandwiched layers can cause birefringence (light is refracted into two separate
  beams causing reading errors); because Blu-ray uses only one layer, the discs do not suffer
  from birefringence.
• Blu-ray discs automatically come with a secure encryption system which helps to prevent
  piracy and copyright infringement.
Table 3.4 summarises the main differences between CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray.

Table 3.4 Main differences between CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray

All these optical storage media are used as back-up systems (for photos, music and multimedia
files). This also means that CDs and DVDs can be used to transfer files between computers.
Manufacturers sometimes supply their software (such as printer drivers) on CDs and DVDs.
When the software is supplied in this way, the disk is usually in a read-only format.
The most common use of DVD and Blu-ray is the supply of movies or games. The memory
capacity of CDs is not big enough to store most movies.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 3D
A recent development is PRAM (parameter RAM) or PCRAM (phase-change RAM) which
utilises chalogenide glass. This is glass containing elements such as sulphur, antimony,
selenium, germanium or tellurium. Chalogenide compounds used in PRAMs/PCRAMs can be
changed between the amorphous (glass-like) state and crystalline state, which changes the
optical and electrical properties allowing the storage of data when used as a film on the surface
of optical media.
Find out more about this technology and determine whether this could result in the demise of

the current solid state removable devices.

3.1.2 Input and output devices
This section will consider laser printers, inkjet printers, 3D printers, speakers, microphones,
screens and sensors.

Laser printers
Laser printers use dry powder ink rather than liquid ink and make use of the properties of static
electricity to produce the text and images. Unlike inkjet printers, for example, laser printers print
the whole page in one go. Colour laser printers use four toner cartridges – blue, cyan, magenta
and black. Although the actual technology is different to monochrome printers, the printing
method is similar, but colour dots are used to build up the text and images.

Figure 3.9 A laser printer

When a user wishes to print a document using a laser printer, the following sequence of events
takes place.

 Stage Description of what happens
 1          data from the document is sent to a printer driver
 2          printer driver ensures that the data is in a format that the chosen printer can understand
 3          check is made by the printer driver to ensure that the chosen printer is available to
            print (is it busy? is it off-line? is it out of ink? and so on)
 4          data is sent to the printer and stored in a temporary memory known as a printer buffer
 5          printing drum given a positive charge. As this drum rotates, a laser beam scans across
            it removing the positive charge in certain areas, leaving negatively charged areas
            which exactly match the text/images of the page to be printed
 6          drum is coated with positively charged toner (powdered ink). Since the toner is
            positively charged, it only sticks to the negatively charged parts of the drum
 7          negatively charged sheet of paper is rolled over the drum
 8          toner on the drum sticks to the paper to produce an exact copy of the page sent to the
            printer

 9          to prevent the paper sticking to the drum, the electric charge on the paper is removed

            after one rotation of the drum
 10         the paper goes through a fuser (a set of heated rollers), where the heat melts the ink so
            that it fixes permanently to the paper
 11         a discharge lamp removes all the electric charge from the drum so it is ready to print
            the next page
Table 3.5 Sequence to print using a laser printer

Inkjet printers
Inkjet printers are made up of
• a print head consisting of nozzles that spray droplets of ink onto the paper to form characters
• an ink cartridge or cartridges; either one cartridge for each colour (blue, yellow and magenta)
  and a black cartridge, or one single cartridge containing all three colours and black (note: some
  systems use six colours)
• a stepper motor and belt which moves the print head assembly across the page from side to
  side
• a paper feed which automatically feeds the printer with pages as they are required.

Figure 3.10 An inkjet printer

The ink droplets are currently produced using one of two technologies: thermal bubble or
piezoelectric.
Thermal bubble – tiny resistors create localised heat which makes the ink vaporise. This causes
the ink to form a tiny bubble, as the bubble expands some of the ink is ejected from the print
head onto the paper. When the bubble collapses, a small vacuum is created which allows fresh
ink to be drawn into the print head. This continues until the printing cycle is completed.
Piezoelectric – a crystal is located at the back of the ink reservoir for each nozzle. The crystal is
given a tiny electric charge which makes it vibrate. This vibration forces ink to be ejected onto
the paper and at the same time more ink is drawn in for further printing.
When a user wishes to print a document using an inkjet printer, the following sequence of events
takes place. Whatever technology is used, the basic steps in the printing process are the same.

 Stage Description of what happens
 1          data from the document is sent to a printer driver
 2          printer driver ensures that the data is in a format that the chosen printer can understand

 3          check is made by the printer driver to ensure that the chosen printer is available to
            print (is it busy? is it off-line? is it out of ink? and so on)
 4          data is sent to the printer and stored in a temporary memory known as a printer buffer
 5          a sheet of paper is fed into the main body of the printer. A sensor detects whether
            paper is available in the paper feed tray – if it is out of paper (or the paper is jammed),
            an error message is sent back to the computer
 6          as the sheet of paper is fed through the printer, the print head moves from side to side
            across the paper printing the text or image. The four ink colours are sprayed in their
            exact amounts to produce the desired final colour
 7          at the end of each full pass of the print head, the paper is advanced very slightly to
            allow the next line to be printed. This continues until the whole page has been printed
 8          if there is more data in the printer buffer, then the whole process from stage 5 is
            repeated until the buffer is empty
 9          once the printer buffer is empty, the printer sends an interrupt to the processor in the
            computer, which is a request for more data to be sent to the printer. The process
            continues until the whole of the document has been printed

3D printers

Figure 3.11 A 3D printer

3D printers are used to produce working, solid objects. They are primarily based on inkjet and
laser printer technology. The solid object is built up layer by layer using materials such as
powdered resin, powdered metal, paper or ceramic.
The artificial bone framework in Figure 3.12 was made from many layers (100 µm thick) of
powered metal using a technology known as binder 3D printing.

Figure 3.12 Artificial bone framework made using an industrial 3D printer

Various types of 3D printers exist; they range from the size of a microwave oven up to the size
of a small car.
3D printers use additive manufacturing (the object is built up layer by layer); this is in contrast to
the more traditional method of subtractive manufacturing (removal of material to make the
object). For example, making a statue using a 3D printer would involve building it up layer by

layer using powdered stone until the final object was formed. The subtractive method would
involve carving the statue out of solid stone (removing the stone not required) until the final item
was produced. Similarly, CNC machining removes metal to form an object; 3D printing would
produce the same item by building up the object from layers of powdered metal.
Direct 3D printing uses inkjet technology; a print head can move left to right as in a normal
printer. However, the print head can also move up and down to build up the layers of an object.
Binder 3D printing is similar to direct 3D printing. However, this method uses two passes for
each of the layers; the first pass sprays dry powder and then on the second pass a binder (a type
of glue) is sprayed to form a solid layer.
Newer technologies use lasers and UV light to harden liquid polymers; this further increases the
diversity of products which can be made.

Speakers and microphones
Speakers
Digitised sound stored in a file on a computer can be converted into sound as follows:
• The digital data is first passed through a digital to analogue converter (DAC) where it is
  converted into an electric current.
• This is then passed through an amplifier (since the current generated by the DAC will be
  small) to create a current large enough to drive a loudspeaker.
• This electric current is then fed to a loudspeaker where it is converted into sound.
The following schematic shows how this is done.

Figure 3.13 Digital to analogue conversion

As Figure 3.13 shows, if the sound is stored in a computer file, it must first pass through a digital
to analogue converter (DAC) to convert the digital data into an electric current which can be
used to drive the loudspeaker. Figure 3.14 shows how a loudspeaker can convert electric signals
into sound waves.

Figure 3.14 Diagram showing how a loudspeaker works

• When an electric current flows through a coil of wire that is wrapped around an iron core, the
  core becomes a temporary electromagnet; a permanent magnet is also positioned very close to
  this electromagnet.
• As the electric current through the coil of wire varies, the induced magnetic field in the iron
  core also varies. This causes the iron core to be attracted towards the permanent magnet and as
  the current varies this will cause the iron core to vibrate.
• Since the iron core is attached to a cone (made from paper or thin synthetic material), this
  causes the cone to vibrate, producing sound.
The rate at which the DAC can translate the digital output into analogue voltages is known as the
sampling rate. If the DAC is a 16-bit device, then it can accept numbers between +32 767 (216 –
1) and –32 768 (216); the digital value containing all zeros is ignored.
Microphones
Microphones are either built into the computer or are external devices connected through the
USB port or through wireless connectivity.
Figure 3.15 shows how a microphone can convert sound waves into an electric current. The
current produced can either be stored as sound (on, for example, a CD), amplified and sent to a
loudspeaker, or sent to a computer for storage.

Figure 3.15 Diagram of how a microphone works

• When sound is created, it causes the air to vibrate.

• When a diaphragm in the microphone picks up the air vibrations, the diaphragm also begins to
  vibrate.
• A copper coil is wrapped around a permanent magnet and the coil is connected to the
  diaphragm using a cone. As the diaphragm vibrates, the cone moves in and out causing the
  copper coil to move backwards and forwards.
• This forwards and backwards motion causes the magnetic field around the permanent magnet
  to be disturbed, inducing an electric current.
• The electric current is then either amplified or sent to a recording device. The electric current
  is analogue in nature.
The electric current output from the microphone can also be sent to a computer where a sound
card converts the current into a digital signal which can then be stored in the computer. The
following diagram shows what happens when the word ‘hut’ is picked up by a microphone and is
converted into digital values:
Look at Figure 3.16. The word ‘hut’ (in the form of a sound wave) has been picked up by a
microphone; this is then converted using an analogue to digital converter (ADC) into digital
values which can then be stored in a computer or manipulated as required using appropriate
software.

Figure 3.16 Analogue to digital conversion

Screens
Screens are used to show the output from a computer. Modern screens use an LCD, backlit with
LEDs or the newer organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology.
Figure 3.17 shows a simplified form of how OLED technology works.

Figure 3.17 Simplified form of how OLED technology works

OLEDs use organic materials (made up of carbon compounds) to create flexible semiconductors.
Organic films are sandwiched between two charged electrodes (one is a metallic cathode and the
other a glass anode). When an electric field is applied to the electrodes, they give off light. This
means that no form of back lighting is required. This allows for very thin screens. It also means

that there is no longer a need to use LCD technology, since OLED is a self-contained system.
Screen displays are based on the pixel (the smallest picture element) concept where each screen
pixel is made up of three sub-pixels, which are red, green and blue. By varying the intensity of
the three sub-pixels, it is possible to generate millions of colours. The greater the number of
pixels on a screen, the greater is the screen resolution (the number of pixels which can be
viewed horizontally and vertically on screen; for example, 1680 × 1080 pixels). LCD and OLED
screens use this type of pixel matrix to make up the picture.

Figure 3.18 The pixel matrix

Touch screens (which act as both input and output devices) also make use of LCD and OLED
technology. They are particularly used in mobile phones and tablets.
We shall now consider LCD capacitive and resistive touch screen technologies.
Capacitive
• Made up of many layers of glass that act like a capacitor creating electric fields between the
  glass plates in layers.
• When the top glass layer is touched, the electric current changes and the coordinates where the
  screen was touched are determined by an on board microprocessor.
Benefits
• Medium cost technology.
• Screen visibility is good even in strong sunlight.
• Permits multi-touch capability.
• Screen is very durable; it takes a major impact to break the glass.
Drawbacks
• Only allows use of bare fingers as the form of input; although the latest screens permit the use
  of a special stylus to be used.
Resistive
• Makes use of an upper layer of polyester (a form of plastic) and a bottom layer of glass.
• When the top polyester layer is touched, the top layer and bottom layer complete a circuit.
• Signals are then sent out, which are interpreted by a microprocessor and the calculations
  determine the coordinates of where the screen was touched.
Benefits
• Relatively inexpensive technology.
• Possible to use bare fingers, gloved fingers or stylus to carry out an input operation.
Drawbacks

• Screen visibility is poor in strong sunlight.
• Does not permit multi-touch capability.
• Screen durability is only fair; it is vulnerable to scratches and the screen wears out through
  time.

Virtual headsets
Virtual reality has now been around for many years and has many applications. For example, it is
possible to ‘walk around’ inside dangerous areas – such as a nuclear power plant – without
actually being there.
It allows engineers to plan modifications or repairs to a plant in complete safety and to try out
different scenarios first before implementing them. One of the devices used is a virtual reality
headset which gives the engineer the feeling of being there. We will now describe how these
devices work.
• Video is sent from a computer to the headset (either using an HDMI cable or a smartphone
   fitted into the headset).
• Two feeds are sent to an LCD/OLED display (sometimes two screens are used, one for the left
   side of the image and one for the right side of the image); lenses placed between the eyes and
   the screen allow for focusing and reshaping of the image/video for each eye, thus giving a 3D
   effect and adding to the realism.
• Most headsets use 110° field of view which is enough to give a pseudo 360° surround
   image/video.
• A frame rate of 60 to 120 images per second is used to give a true/realistic image.
• As the user moves their head (up and down or left to right), a series of sensors and/or LEDs
   measure this movement, which allows the image/video on the screen to react to the user’s head
   movements (sensors are usually gyroscopic or accelerometers; LEDs are used in conjunction
   with mini cameras to further monitor head movements).
• Headsets also use binaural sound (surround sound) so that the speaker output appears to come
   from behind, from the side or from a distance, giving very realistic 3D sound.
• Some headsets also use infrared sensors to monitor eye movement (in addition to head
   movement), which allows the depth of field on the screen to be more realistic; an example of
   this is to make objects in the foreground appear fuzzy when the user’s eyes indicate they are
   looking into the distance (and vice versa).

Sensors
Sensors are input devices which read or measure physical properties, such as temperature,
pressure, acidity, and so on.
Real data is analogue in nature – this means it is constantly changing and does not have a
discrete value. Analogue data usually requires some form of interpretation, for example, the
temperature shown on a mercury thermometer requires the user to look at the height of the
mercury to work out the temperature. The temperature, therefore, can have an infinite number of
values depending on the precision of how the height of the mercury is measured. Equally, an
analogue clock requires the user to look at the hands on the clock face. The area swept out by the
hands allows the number of hours and minutes to be interpreted. There are many other examples.

Computers cannot make any sense of these physical quantities and the data needs to be converted
into a digital format. This is usually achieved by an analogue to digital converter (ADC). This
device converts physical values into discrete digital values.

Figure 3.19 Converting analogue data into digital data

When a computer is used to control devices, such as a motor or a valve, it is often necessary to
use a digital to analogue converter (DAC), since these devices need analogue data to operate in
many cases. Frequently, an actuator is used in these control applications. Although these are
technically output devices, they are mentioned here since they are an integral part of the control
system. An actuator is an electromechanical device such as a relay, solenoid or motor. Note that
a solenoid is an example of a digital actuator as part of the device is connected to a computer
which opens and closes a circuit as required. When energized, the solenoid may operate a
plunger or armature to control, for example, a fuel injection system. Other actuators, such as
motors and valves, may require a DAC so that they receive an electric current rather than a
simple digital signal direct from the computer.
Notice the importance of (positive) feedback, which is where the output from the system can
affect the next input. This is due to the fact that sensor readings may cause the microprocessor to
alter a valve or a motor, for example, which will then change the next reading taken by the
sensor. So the output from the microprocessor will impact on the next input received as it
attempts to bring the system within the desired parameters.
Table 3.7 shows a number of common sensors and examples of their applications.

Table 3.7 Common sensors and examples of applications

Sensors are used in both monitoring and control applications. There is a subtle difference
between how these two methods work. The flowchart (Figure 3.21 overleaf) shows a
simplification of the process.

Table 3.8 Examples of monitoring and control applications of sensors

One of the most common uses of sensors in modern times is in the monitoring and control of a
number of functions in motor vehicles and aeroplanes. Look at Figure 3.21 showing a typical
modern car and its many sensors used to control or monitor several functions.
Below is an in-depth look at just one of the sensor systems labelled on Figure 3.21.
Anti-lock braking systems (on cars)
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) on cars use magnetic field sensors to stop the wheels locking
up on the car if the brakes have been applied too sharply.

• When one of the car wheels rotates too slowly (it is locking up), a magnetic field sensor sends
  data to a microprocessor.
• The microprocessor checks the rotation speed of the other three wheels.
• If they are different (rotating faster), the microprocessor sends a signal to the braking system
  and the braking pressure to the affected wheel is reduced.
• The wheel’s rotational speed is then increased to match the other wheels.
• The checking of the rotational speed using these magnetic field sensors is done several times a
  second and the braking pressure to all the wheels can be constantly changing to prevent any of
  the wheels locking up under heavy braking.
• This is felt as a ‘judder’ on the brake pedal as the braking system is constantly switched off
  and on to equalise the rotational speed of all four wheels.
• If one of the wheels is rotating too quickly, braking pressure is increased to that wheel until it
  matches the other three.

3.2 Logic gates and logic circuits
Key terms
Logic gates – electronic circuits which rely on ‘on/off’ logic. The most common ones are
NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR.
Logic circuit – formed from a combination of logic gates and designed to carry out a particular
task. The output from a logic circuit will be 0 or 1.
Truth table – a method of checking the output from a logic circuit. They use all the possible
binary input combinations depending on the number of inputs; for example, two inputs have 22
(4) possible binary combinations, three inputs will have 23 (8) possible binary combinations,
and so on.
Boolean algebra – a form of algebra linked to logic circuits and based on TRUE and FALSE.

3.2.1 Logic gates
Electronic circuits in computers, many memories and controlling devices are made up of
thousands of logic gates. Logic gates take binary inputs and produce a binary output. Several
logic gates combined together form a logic circuit and these circuits are designed to carry out a
specific function. The checking of the output from a logic gate or logic circuit can be done using
a truth table.
This section will consider the function and role of logic gates, logic circuits and truth tables. A
number of possible applications of logic circuits will also be considered. A reference to Boolean
algebra will be made throughout this section, although this is covered in more depth in Chapter
15.
Six different logic gates will be considered in this section.

Figure 3.22 Six types of logic gate

3.2.2 Truth tables
Truth tables are used to trace the output from a logic gate or logic circuit. The NOT gate is the
only logic gate with one input; the other five gates have two inputs. When constructing truth
tables, all possible combinations of 1s and 0s which can be input are considered. For the NOT
gate (one input) there are only 21 (2) possible binary combinations. For all other gates (two
inputs), there are 22 (4) possible binary combinations.
For logic circuits, the number of inputs can be more than 2; for example, three inputs give a
possible 23 (8) binary combinations. And for four inputs, the number of possible binary
combinations is 24 (16). It is clear that the number of possible binary combinations is a multiple
of the number 2 in every case. Table 3.9 summarises this.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 3G
Using truth tables show that X = (A. ) + (Ā.B) and X = (A + B) .          both represent the XOR
logic gate.

You will notice, in the Boolean algebra, three new symbols.
• A dot (.) represents the AND operation (it can be written as ∧).
• A plus sign (+) represents the OR operation (it can be written as ∨).
• A dash above a letter (for example, Ā) represents the NOT operation.

3.2.4 Logic circuits
When logic gates are combined to carry out a particular function, such as controlling a robot,
they form a logic circuit.
The output from the logic circuit is checked using a truth table. The following three examples
show how to:
• produce a truth table
• design a logic circuit from a given logic statement/Boolean algebra
• design a logic circuit to carry out an actual safety function.

Example 3.1
Produce a truth table for the following logic circuit (note the use of   • at junctions):

 Solution
 There are three inputs to this logic circuit; therefore, there will be eight possible binary values
 which can be input.
 To show step-wise how the truth table is produced, the logic circuit has been split up into
 three parts and intermediate values are shown as P, Q and R.
 Part 1
 This is the first part of the logic circuit; the first task is to find the intermediate values P and
 Q.

The value of P is found from the AND gate where the inputs are A and B. The value of Q is
found from the NOR gate where the inputs are B and C. An intermediate truth table is
produced:

Part 2
The second part of the logic circuit has P and Q as inputs and the intermediate output, R.

This produces the following intermediate truth table (Note: even though there are only two
inputs to the logic gate, we have generated eight binary values in Part 1 and these must all be
used in this second truth table).

                   Inputs                                         Output
          P                     Q                                    R
          0                     1                                    1
          0                     0                                    0
          0                     0                                    0
          0                     0                                    0

          0                      1                                     1
          0                      0                                     0
          1                      0                                     1
          1                      0                                     1

Part 3
The final part of the logic circuit has R and C as inputs and the final output, X.

This gives the third intermediate truth table.
Putting all three intermediate truth tables together produces the final truth table which
represents the original logic circuit.

                   Inputs                                          Output
          R                      C                                    X
           1                      0                                    1
           0                      1                                    1
           0                      0                                    0
           0                      1                                    1
           1                      0                                    1
           0                      1                                    1
           1                      0                                    1
           1                      1                                    0

ACTIVITY 3B
Produce truth tables for each of the following logic circuits. You are advised to split them up
into intermediate parts to help eliminate errors.
a)

b)

c)

d)

e)

Example 3.2
A safety system uses three inputs to a logic circuit. An alarm, X, sounds if input A represents
ON and input B represents OFF, or if input B represents ON and input C represents OFF.
Produce a logic circuit and truth table to show the conditions which cause the output X to be 1.
Solution
The first thing to do is to write down the logic statement representing the scenario in this
example. To do this, it is necessary to recall that ON = 1 and OFF = 0 and also that 0 is
considered to be NOT 1.
So, we get the following logic statement:

This statement can also be written in Boolean algebra as:

The logic circuit is made up of three parts as shown in the logic statement. We will produce
the logic gate for the Part 1 and Part 3, then join both parts together with the OR gate.

Now, combining both parts with Part 2 (the OR gate) gives us:

There are two ways to produce the truth table.

• Trace through the logic circuit using the method described in Example 3.1.
• Use the original logic statement; this allows you to check that your logic circuit is correct.
We will use the second method in this example.

ACTIVITY 3C

Draw the logic circuits and complete the truth tables for these logic statements and Boolean
algebra statements.
a) X = 1 if (A = 1 OR B = 1) OR (A = 0 AND B = 1)
b) Y = 1 if (A = 0 AND B = 0) AND (B = 0 OR C = 1)
c) T = 1 if (switch K is ON or switch L is ON) OR (switch K is ON and switch M is OFF) OR
   (switch M is ON)
d) X = (A.B) + (B.C)
e) R = 1 if (switch A is ON and switch B is ON) AND (switch B is ON or switch C is OFF)

Example 3.3
A wind turbine has a safety system which uses three inputs to a logic circuit. A certain
combination of conditions results in an output, X, from the logic circuit being equal to 1. When
the value of X = 1, the wind turbine is shut down.
The following table shows which parameters are being monitored and form the three inputs to
the logic circuit.

The output, X, will have a value of 1 if any of the following combination of conditions occur:
• either turbine speed ≤ 1000 rpm and bearing temperature > 80 °C
• or turbine speed > 1000 rpm and wind velocity > 120 kph
• or bearing temperature ≤ 80 °C and wind velocity > 120 kph

Design the logic circuit and complete the truth table to produce a value of X = 1 when either
of the three conditions occur.
Solution
This is a different type of problem to those covered in Examples 3.1 and 3.2. This time, a real
situation is given and it is necessary to convert the information into a logic statement and then
produce the logic circuit and truth table. It is advisable in problems as complex as this to
produce the logic circuit and truth table separately (based on the conditions given) and then
check them against each other to see if there are any errors.
Stage 1
The first thing to do is to convert each of the three statements into logic statements. Use the
information given in the table and the three condition statements to find how the three

parameters S, T and W, are linked. We usually look for the key words AND, OR and NOT
when converting actual statements into logic.
We end up with these three logic statements:
① turbine speed  1000 rpm and bearing temperature > 80 °C
  logic statement: (S = NOT 1 AND T = 1)
② turbine speed > 1000 rpm and wind velocity > 120 kph
  logic statement: (S = 1 AND W = 1)
③ bearing temperature  80 °C and wind velocity > 120 kph
  logic statement: (T = NOT 1 AND W = 1)
Stage 2
This produces three intermediate logic circuits:
①

②

③

Each of the three original statements were joined together by the word OR. So, we need to
join all of the three intermediate logic circuits by two OR gates to get the final logic circuit.
We will start by joining ① and ② together using an OR gate.

Now, we connect this to logic circuit ③ to obtain the final logic circuit.

The final part is to produce the truth table. We will do this using the original logic statement,
since this method allows an extra check to be made on the final logic circuit.
There were three parts to the problem, so the truth table will first evaluate each part. Then, by
applying OR gates, as shown below, the final value, X, is obtained:
① (S = NOT 1 AND T = 1)
② (S = 1 AND W = 1)
③ (T = NOT 1 AND W = 1)
We find the outputs from ① and ② and then OR these two outputs to obtain a new
intermediate, which we will label part ④.
We then OR parts ③ and ④ together to get the value of X.

ACTIVITY 3D
There are two scenarios described below. In each case, produce the logic circuit and complete
a truth table to represent the scenario.

a) A chemical process is protected by a logic circuit. There are three inputs to the logic circuit
  representing key parameters in the chemical process.
  An alarm, X, will give an output value of 1 depending on certain conditions in the chemical
  process.
  This table describes the process conditions being monitored.

  An alarm, X, will generate the value 1 if:
  either reaction rate < 40 mol/l/sec
  or concentration > 4 mol AND temperature > 115 °C
  or reaction rate  40 mol/l/sec AND temperature > 115 °C.
b) A power station has a safety system controlled by a logic circuit. Three inputs to the logic
  circuit determine whether the output, S, is 1.
  When S = 1 the power station shuts down.
  The following table describes the conditions being monitored.

  Output, S, will generate a value of 1, if:
  either gas temperature > 160 °C AND water temperature  120 °C
  or gas temperature  160 °C AND reactor pressure > 10 bar
  or water temperature > 120 °C AND reactor pressure > 10 bar.

3.2.5 Logic circuits in the real world
The design of logic circuits is considerably more complex than has, so far, been described. We
have discussed some of the fundamental theories, providing sufficient coverage of the
Cambridge International A Level syllabus. However, it is worth discussing some of the more
advanced aspects of logic circuit design, to strengthen understanding.
Electronics companies need to consider the cost of components, ease of fabrication and time
constraints when designing and building logic circuits.
Ways electronics companies review logic circuit design include:
• using ‘off-the-shelf’ logic units and building up the logic circuit as a number of ‘building
  blocks’
• simplifying the logic circuit as far as possible; this may be necessary where room is at a
  premium (for example, building circuit boards for use in satellites for space exploration).

Using logic ‘building blocks’
One common ‘building block’ is the NAND gate. It is possible to build up any logic gate, and
therefore any logic circuit, by simply linking together a number of NAND gates, such as:
• the AND gate

  Figure 3.29 AND gate made from NAND gates

• the OR gate

  Figure 3.30 OR gate made from NAND gates

• the NOT gate

  Figure 3.31 NOT gate made from NAND gates

ACTIVITY 3E
1 By drawing the truth tables, show that the three logic circuits shown above can be used to
  represent AND, OR and NOT gates.
2 a) Show how the following logic circuit could be built using NAND gates only.
      Complete truth tables for both logic circuits to show that they produce identical outputs.

  b) Show how the XOR gate could be built from NAND gates only.
      Complete a truth table for your final design to show that it produces the same output as a
      single XOR gate.
3 By drawing a truth table, discover which single logic gate has the same function as the
  following logic circuit made up of NAND gates only.

Simplification of logic circuits
The second method involves the simplification of logic circuits. By reducing the number of
components, the cost of production can be less. This can also improve reliability and make it
easier to trace faults if they occur. This is covered in more depth in Chapter 15.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 3H
By drawing a truth table, show which single logic gate has the same function as the logic
circuit drawn below.

3.2.6 Multi-input logic gates
This section looks at logic gates with more than two inputs (apart from the NOT gate). Students
are not expected to answer questions about multi-input logic gates at Cambridge International
AS Level, but this information is included here for completeness and for those with an
electronics background. This is intended to complete the picture for interested students who may
have seen multi-input gates in other textbooks, or online, and it leads neatly into topics covered
in Chapter 15.
Logic gates (apart from the NOT gate) can have more than two inputs. While it is still acceptable
to use two-input logic gates, it is worth considering the multi-input option when designing logic
circuits; they can simplify the overall result.

3 An air conditioning unit in a car is being controlled by a microprocessor and a number of
  sensors.
  a) Describe the main differences between control and monitoring of a process.
                                                                                                    [2]

                                                                                             [6]
4 The nine stages in printing a page using an inkjet printer are shown below. They are not in
  the correct order.
  Write the letters A to I so that the stages are in the correct order.
                                                                                             [9]

   A The data is then sent to the printer and it is stored in a temporary memory known as a
     printer buffer.
   B As the sheet of paper is fed through the printer, the print head moves from side to side
     across the paper printing the text or image. The four ink colours are sprayed in their
     exact amounts to produce the desired final colour.
   C The data from the document is sent to a printer driver.
   D Once the printer buffer is empty, the printer sends an interrupt to the processor in the
     computer, which is a request for more data to be sent to the printer. The whole process
     continues until the whole of the document has been printed.
   E The printer driver ensures that the data is in a format that the chosen printer can
     understand.
   F At the end of each full pass of the print head, the paper is advanced very slightly to
     allow the next line to be printed. This continues until the whole page has been printed.
   G A check is made by the printer driver to ensure that the chosen printer is available to
     print (is it busy? is it off line? is it out of ink? and so on).
   H If there is more data in the printer buffer, then the whole process from stage 5 is
     repeated until the buffer is finally empty.
   I   A sheet of paper is then fed into the main body of the printer, where a sensor detects
       whether paper is available in the paper feed tray – if it is out of paper (or the paper is
       jammed) then an error message is sent back to the computer.

5 a) There are two types of RAM: dynamic RAM (DRAM) and static RAM (SRAM). Five
     statements about DRAM and RAM are shown below. Copy the diagram below and

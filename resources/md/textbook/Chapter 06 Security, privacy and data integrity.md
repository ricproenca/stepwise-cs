Key terms
Data privacy – the privacy of personal information, or other information stored on a computer,
that should not be accessed by unauthorised parties.
Data protection laws – laws which govern how data should be kept private and secure.
Data security – methods taken to prevent unauthorised access to data and to recover data if
lost or corrupted.
User account – an agreement that allows an individual to use a computer or network server,
often requiring a user name and password.
Authentication – a way of proving somebody or something is who or what they claim to be.
Access rights (data security) – use of access levels to ensure only authorised users can gain
access to certain data.
Malware – malicious software that seeks to damage or gain unauthorised access to a computer
system.
Firewall – software or hardware that sits between a computer and external network that
monitors and filters all incoming and outgoing activities.
Anti-spyware software – software that detects and removes spyware programs installed
illegally on a user’s computer system.

Encryption – the use of encryption keys to make data meaningless without the correct
decryption key.
Biometrics – use of unique human characteristics to identify a user (such as fingerprints or
face recognition).
Hacking – illegal access to a computer system without the owner’s permission.
Malicious hacking – hacking done with the sole intent of causing harm to a computer system
or user (for example, deletion of files or use of private data to the hacker’s advantage).
Ethical hacking – hacking used to test the security and vulnerability of a computer system.
The hacking is carried out with the permission of the computer system owner, for example, to
help a company identify risks associated with malicious hacking of their computer systems.
Phishing – legitimate-looking emails designed to trick a recipient into giving their personal
data to the sender of the email.
Pharming – redirecting a user to a fake website in order to illegally obtain personal data about
the user.
DNS cache poisoning – altering IP addresses on a DNS server by a ‘pharmer’ or hacker with
the intention of redirecting a user to their fake website.

6.1.1 Data privacy
Data stored about a person or an organisation must remain private and unauthorised access to the
data must be prevented – data privacy is required.
This is achieved partly by data protection laws. These laws vary from country to country, but
all follow the same eight guiding principles.

 1 Data must be fairly and lawfully processed.

 2 Data can only be processed for the stated purpose.

 3 Data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive.

 4 Data must be accurate.

 5 Data must not be kept longer than necessary.

 6 Data must be processed in accordance with the data subject’s rights.

 7 Data must be kept secure.

 8 Data must not be transferred to another country unless that country also has adequate protection.

Data protection laws usually cover organisations rather than private individuals. Such laws are
no guarantee of privacy, but the legal threat of fines or jail sentences deters most people.

6.1.2 Preventing data loss and restricting data access
Data security refers to the methods used to prevent unauthorised access to data, as well as to the
data recovery methods if it is lost.

User accounts
User accounts are used to authenticate a user (prove that a user is who they say they are). User
accounts are used on both standalone and networked computers in case the computer can be
accessed by a number of people. This is often done by a screen prompt asking for a username
and password:

Figure 6.1 A login screen

User accounts control access rights. This often involves levels of access. For example, in a
hospital it would not be appropriate for a cleaner to have access to data about one of the patients.
However, a consultant would need such access. Therefore, most systems have a hierarchy of
access levels depending on a person’s level of security. This could be achieved by username and
password with each username (account) linked to the appropriate level of access.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 6A
An airport uses a computer system to control security, flight bookings, passenger lists,
administration and customer services. Describe how it is possible to ensure the safety of the
data on the system so that senior staff can see all data, while customers can only access flight

times (arrivals and departures) and duty free offers.

Use of passwords
Passwords are used to restrict access to data or systems. They should be hard to crack and
changed frequently to retain security. Passwords can also take the form of biometrics (such as on
a mobile phone, as discussed later). Passwords are also used, for example, when
• accessing email accounts
• carrying out online banking or shopping
• accessing social networking sites.
It is important that passwords are protected. Some ways of doing this are to
• run anti-spyware software to make sure your passwords are not being relayed to whoever put
   the spyware on your computer
• regularly change passwords in case they have been seen by someone else, illegally or
   accidentally
• make sure passwords are difficult to crack or guess (for example, do not use your date of birth
   or pet’s name).
Passwords are grouped as either strong (hard to crack or guess) or weak (relatively easy to crack
or guess). Strong passwords should contain
• at least one capital letter
• at least one numerical value
• at least one other keyboard character (such as @, *, &)
Example of a strong password: Sy12@#TT90kj=0
Example of a weak password: GREEN

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 6B
Which of the following are weak passwords and which are strong passwords?
Explain your decision in each case.
a) 25-May-2000
b) Pas5word
c) ChapTer@06
d) N55!
e) 12345X

Digital signatures
Digital signatures protect data by providing a way of identifying the sender of, for example, an
email. These are covered in more depth in Chapter 17.

Use of firewalls

A firewall can be software or hardware. It sits between the user’s computer and an external
network (such as the internet) and filters information in and out of the computer. This allows the
user to decide to allow communication with an external source and warns a user that an external
source is trying to access their computer. Firewalls are the primary defence to any computer
system to protect from hacking, malware (viruses and spyware), phishing and pharming.

Figure 6.2 Firewall

The tasks carried out by a firewall include
• examining the traffic between the user’s computer (or internal network) and a public network
  (such as the internet)
• checking whether incoming or outgoing data meets a given set of criteria
• blocking the traffic if the data fails to meet the criteria, and giving the user (or network
  manager) a warning that there may be a security issue
• logging all incoming and outgoing traffic to allow later interrogation by the user (or network
  manager)
• preventing access to certain undesirable sites – the firewall can keep a list of all undesirable IP
  addresses
• helping to prevent viruses or hackers entering the user’s computer (or internal network)
• warning the user if some software on their system is trying to access an external data source
  (such as an automatic software upgrade). The user is given the option of allowing it to go
  ahead or request that such access is denied.
The firewall can be a hardware interface which is located somewhere between the computer (or
internal network external link) and the internet connection. In these cases, it is often referred to
as a gateway. Alternatively, the firewall can be software installed on a computer, sometimes as
part of the operating system.
However, sometimes the firewall cannot prevent potential harmful traffic. It cannot
• prevent individuals, on internal networks, using their own modems to by-pass the firewall
• control employee misconduct or carelessness (for example, control of passwords or user
  accounts)
• prevent users on stand-alone computers from disabling the firewall.
These issues require management and/or personal control to ensure the firewall can work
effectively.

Antivirus software
Running antivirus software in the background on a computer will constantly check for virus
attacks. Although different types of antivirus software work in different ways, they all
• check software or files before they are run or loaded on a computer
• compare possible viruses against a database of known viruses
• carry out heuristic checking (check software for behaviour that could indicate a virus, which is

  useful if software is infected by a virus not yet on the database)
• quarantine files or programs which are possibly infected and
  – allow the virus to be automatically deleted, or
  – allow the user to make the decision about deletion (it is possible that the user knows that the
    file or program is not infected by a virus – this is known as a false positive and is one of the
    drawbacks of antivirus software).
Antivirus software needs to be kept up to date since new viruses are constantly being discovered.
Full system checks need to be carried out regularly (once a week, for example), since some
viruses lie dormant and would only be picked up by this full system scan.

Anti-spyware software
Anti-spyware software detects and removes spyware programs installed illegally on a user’s
computer system. The software is either based on rules (it looks for typical features associated
with spyware) or based on known file structures which can identify common spyware programs.

Encryption
If data on a computer has been accessed illegally (by a hacker, for example) it is possible to
encrypt the data, making it virtually impossible to understand without encryption keys to decode
it. This cannot stop a hacker from deleting the files, but it will stop them using the data for
themselves. This is covered in more depth in Chapter 17.

Biometrics
In an attempt to stay one step ahead of hackers and malware writers, many modern computer
devices use biometrics as part of the password system. Biometrics rely on the unique
characteristics of human beings. Examples include fingerprint scans, retina scans (pattern of
blood capillary structure), face recognition and voice recognition.
Fingerprint scans
Images of fingerprints are compared against previously scanned fingerprints stored in a database;
if they match then access is allowed; the system compares patterns of ‘ridges’ and ‘valleys’
which are fairly unique (accuracy is about 1 in 500).

Figure 6.3 Fingerprint

Retina scans
Retina scans use infra-red to scan the unique pattern of blood vessels in the retina (at the back of
the eye). It requires a person to stay still for 10 to 15 seconds while the scan takes place; it is
very secure since nobody has yet found a way to duplicate the blood vessels patterns’ (accuracy
is about 1 in 10 million).

Figure 6.4 Retina scan

Mobile phones use biometrics to identify if the phone user is the owner.

6.1.3 Risks to the security of stored data
Hacking
You will see the term hacking used throughout this textbook. There are two types of hacking:
malicious and ethical.
Malicious hacking is the illegal access to a computer system without the user’s permission or
knowledge. It is usually employed with the intention of deleting, altering or corrupting files, or to
gain personal details such as bank account details. Strong passwords, firewalls and software
which can detect illegal activity all guard against hacking.
Ethical hacking is authorised by companies to check their security measures and how robust
their computer systems are to resist hacking attacks. It is legal, and is done with a company’s
permission with a fee paid to the ethical hacker.

Malware
Malware is one of the biggest risks to the integrity and security of data on a computer system.
Many software applications sold as antivirus are capable of identifying and removing most of the
forms of malware described below.
Viruses
Programs or program code that can replicate and/or copy themselves with the intention of
deleting or corrupting files or causing the computer to malfunction. They need an active host
program on the target computer or an operating system that has already been infected before they
can run.
Worms
A type of stand-alone virus that can replicate themselves with the intention of spreading to other
computers; they often use networks to search out computers with weak security.
Logic bombs
Code embedded in a program on a computer. When certain conditions are met (such as a specific
date) they are activated to carry out tasks such as deleting files or sending data to a hacker.
Trojan horses
Malicious programs often disguised as legitimate software. They replace all or part of the
legitimate software with the intent of carrying out some harm to the user’s computer system.
Bots (internet robots)
Not always harmful and can be used, for example, to search automatically for an item on the
internet. However, they can cause harm by taking control over a computer system and launching
attacks.
Spyware
Software that gathers information by monitoring, for example, key presses on the user’s

keyboard. The information is then sent back to the person who sent the software – sometimes
referred to as key logging software.

Phishing
Phishing is when someone sends legitimate-looking emails to users. They may contain links or
attachments which, when clicked, take the user to a fake website, or they may trick the user into
responding with personal data such as bank account details or credit card numbers. The email
often appears to come from a trusted source such as a bank or service provider. The key is that
the recipient has to carry out a task (click a link, for example) before the phishing scam causes
harm.
There are numerous ways to help prevent phishing attacks:
• Users need to be aware of new phishing scams. Those people in industry or commerce should
  undergo frequent security awareness training to become aware of how to identify phishing
  (and pharming) scams.
• Do not click on links unless certain that it is safe to do so; fake emails can often be identified
  by greetings such as ‘Dear Customer’ or ‘Dear emailperson@gmail.com’, and so on.
• It is important to run anti-phishing toolbars on web browsers (this includes tablets and mobile
  phones) since these will alert the user to malicious websites contained in an email.
• Look out for https and/or the green padlock symbol in the address bar (both suggest that traffic
  to and from the website is encrypted).
• Regularly check online accounts and frequently change passwords.
• Ensure an up-to-date browser, with all of the latest security upgrades, is running, and run a
  good firewall in the background at all times. A combination of a desktop firewall (usually
  software) and a network firewall (usually hardware) considerably reduces risk.
• Be wary of pop-ups – use the web browser to block them; if pop-ups get through your
  defences, do not click on ‘cancel’ since this often leads to phishing or pharming sites – the best
  option is to select the small X in the top right hand corner of the pop-up window, which closes
  it down.

Pharming
Pharming is malicious code installed on a user’s computer or on a web server. The code re-
directs the user to a fake website without their knowledge (the user does not have to take any
action, unlike phishing). The creator of the malicious code can gain personal data such as bank
details from users. Often, the website appears to belong to a trusted company and can lead to
fraud or identity theft.
Why does pharming pose a threat to data security?
Pharming redirects users to a fake or malicious website set up by, for example, a hacker.
Redirection from a legitimate website can be done using DNS cache poisoning.
Every time a user types in a URL, their web browser contacts the DNS server. The IP address of
the website is then sent back to their web browser. However, DNS cache poisoning changes the
real IP address values to those of the fake website consequently, the user’s computer connects to
the fake website.

Pharmers can also send malicious programming code to a user’s computer. The code is stored on
the HDD without their knowledge. Whenever the user types in the website address of the
targeted website, the malicious programming code alters the IP address sent back to their
browser which redirects it to the fake website.
Protection against pharming
It is possible to mitigate the risk of pharming by
• using antivirus software, which can detect unauthorised alterations to a website address and
   warn the user
• using modern web browsers that alert users to pharming and phishing attacks
• checking the spelling of websites
• checking for https and/or the green padlock symbol in the address bar.
It is more difficult to mitigate risk if the DNS server itself has been infected (rather than the
user’s computer).

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 6C
Pharmers alter IP addresses in order to send users to fake websites. However, the internet does
not only have one DNS server. Find out how a user’s internet service provider (ISP) uses its
own DNS servers which cache information from other internet DNS servers.

6.1.4 Data recovery
This section covers the potential impact on data caused by accidental mal-operation, hardware
malfunction and software malfunction.
In each case, the method of data recovery and safeguards to minimise the risk are considered.

Figure 6.5 Safeguards

In all cases, the backing up of data regularly (automatically and/or manually at the end of the
day) onto another medium (such as cloud storage, or removable HDD) is key to data recovery.
The back-up should be stored in a separate location in case of, for example, a fire or an office
break-in. Somebody should be given the role of carrying out back-ups, to ensure it it always
done.

Backing up data may not be a suitable method of recovery in the case of a virus infection, as the
backed up data may contain strands of the virus which could re-infect the ‘cleaned’ computer.

ACTIVITY 6A
1 A company has offices in four different countries. Communication and data sharing between
  the offices is done via computers connecting over the internet.
  Describe three data security issues the company might encounter during their day to day
  communications and data sharing.

    6.2 Data integrity
WHAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW
Try these three questions before you read the second part of this chapter.
1 Look at the following validation screen from a spreadsheet.
  Why is it important to have validation in applications such as spreadsheets?

2 Why is proofreading not the same as verification?
3 Discuss one way online form designers can ensure that only certain data can be input by a
  user. Use the date: 12 March 2019 as the example.

Key terms
Data integrity – the accuracy, completeness and consistency of data.
Validation – method used to ensure entered data is reasonable and meets certain input criteria.
Verification – method used to ensure data is correct by using double entry or visual checks.

Check digit – additional digit appended to a number to check if entered data is error free.
Modulo-11 – method used to calculate a check digit based on modulus division by 11.
Checksum – verification method used to check if data transferred has been altered or
corrupted, calculated from the block of data to be sent.
Parity check – method used to check if data has been transferred correctly that uses even or
odd parity.
Parity bit – an extra bit found at the end of a byte that is set to 1 if the parity of the byte needs
to change to agree with sender/receiver parity protocol.
Odd parity – binary number with an odd number of 1-bits.
Even parity – binary number with an even number of 1-bits.
Parity block – horizontal and vertical parity check on a block of data being transferred.

Data stored on a computer should always be accurate, consistent and up to date. Two of the
methods used to ensure data integrity are validation and verification.
The accuracy (integrity) of data can be compromised
• during the data entry and data transmission stages
• by malicious attacks on the data, for example caused by malware and hacking
• by accidental data loss caused through hardware issues.
These risks – together with ways of mitigating them – are discussed in the rest of this chapter.

6.2.1 Validation
Validation is a method of checking if entered data is reasonable (and within a given criteria), but
it cannot check if data is correct or accurate. For example, if somebody accidentally enters their
age as 62 instead of 26, it is reasonable but not accurate or correct. Validation is carried out by
computer software; the most common types are shown in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1 Common validation

Key terms
Parity byte – additional byte sent with transmitted data to enable vertical parity checking (as

well as horizontal parity checking) to be carried out.
Automatic repeat request (ARQ) – a type of verification check.
Acknowledgement – message sent to a receiver to indicate that data has been received without
error.
Timeout – time allowed to elapse before an acknowledgement is received.

6.2.2 Verification
Verification is a way of preventing errors when data is entered manually (using a keyboard, for
example) or when data is transferred from one computer to another.

Verification during data entry
When data is manually entered into a computer it needs to undergo verification to ensure there
are no errors. There are three ways of doing this: double entry, visual check and check digits.
Double entry
Data is entered twice, using two different people, and then compared (either after data entry or
during the data entry process).
Visual check
Entered data is compared with the original document (in other words, what is on the screen is
compared to the data on the original paper documents).
Check digits
The check digit is an additional digit added to a number (usually in the right-most position).
They are often used in barcodes, ISBNs (found on the cover of a book) and VINs (vehicle
identification number). The check digit can be used to ensure the barcode, for example, has been
correctly inputted. The check digit can catch errors including
• an incorrect digit being entered (such as 8190 instead of 8180)
• a transposition error where two numbers have been swapped (such as 8108 instead of 8180)
• digits being omitted or added (such as 818 or 81180 instead of 8180)
• phonetic errors such as 13 (thirteen) instead of 30 (thirty).
Figure 6.6 shows a barcode with an ISBN-13 code with check digit.

Figure 6.6 Barcode

An example of a check digit calculation is modulo-11. The following algorithm is used to
generate the check digit for a number with seven digits:
1 Each digit in the number is given a weighting of 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1, starting from the left.
2 The digit is multiplied by its weighting and then each value is added to make a total.
3 The total is divided by 11 and the remainder subtracted from 11.
4 The check digit is the value generated; note if the check digit is 10 then X is used.
For example:

When this number is entered, the check digit is recalculated and, if the same value is not
generated, an error has occurred. For example, if 4 1 5 7 6 1 0 4 was entered, the check digit
generated would be 3, indicating an error.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 6D
 1 Find out how the ISBN-13 method works and confirm that the number 978 034 098 382 has
    a check digit of 9.
 2 Find the check digits for the following numbers using both modulo-11 and ISBN-13.
   a) 213 111 000 428
   b) 909 812 123 544
 3 Find a common use for the modulo-11 method of generating check digits.

Verification during data transfer
When data is transferred electronically from one device to another, there is always the possibility
of data corruption or even data loss. A number of ways exist to minimise this risk.
Checksums
A checksum is a method to check if data has been changed or corrupted following data
transmission. Data is sent in blocks and an additional value, the checksum, is sent at the end of
the block of data.
To explain how this works, we will assume the checksum of a block of data is 1 byte in length.
This gives a maximum value of 28 − 1 (= 255). The value 0000 0000 is ignored in this
calculation. The following explains how a checksum is generated.
If the sum of all the bytes in the transmitted block of data is ≤ 255, then the checksum is this
value. However, if the sum of all the bytes in the data block > 255, then the checksum is found
using the following simple algorithm.
In the example we will assume the value of X is 1185.

Figure 6.7

When a block of data is about to be transmitted, the checksum for the bytes is first calculated.
This value is transmitted with the block of data. At the receiving end, the checksum is re-
calculated from the block of data received. This calculated value is compared to the checksum
transmitted. If they are the same, then the data was transmitted without any errors; if they are
different, then a request is sent for the data to be re-transmitted.
Parity checks
A parity check is another method to check whether data has been changed or corrupted
following transmission from one device or medium to another.
A byte of data, for example, is allocated a parity bit. This is allocated before transmission.
Systems that use even parity have an even number of 1-bits; systems that use odd parity have
an odd number of 1-bits.
Consider the following byte:

Figure 6.8

If this byte is using even parity, then the parity bit needs to be 0 since there is already an even
number of 1-bits (in this case, four).
If odd parity is being used, then the parity bit needs to be 1 to make the number of 1-bits odd.
Therefore, the byte just before transmission would be:

Figure 6.9

Before data is transferred, an agreement is made between sender and receiver regarding which of
the two types of parity are used. This is an example of a protocol.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 6E
Find the parity bits for each of the following bytes:
1 1101101            even parity used
2 0001111            even parity used
3 0111000            even parity used
4 1110100            odd parity used
5 1011011            odd parity used

If a byte has been transmitted from ‘A’ to ‘B’, and even parity is used, an error would be flagged
if the byte now had an odd number of 1-bits at the receiver’s end.
For example:

Figure 6.10

In this case, the receiver’s byte has three 1-bits, which means it now has odd parity, while the
byte from the sender had even parity (four 1-bits). This means an error has occurred during the
transmission of the data.
The error is detected by the computer re-calculating the parity of the byte sent. If even parity has
been agreed between sender and receiver, then a change of parity in the received byte indicates
that a transmission error has occurred.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 6F
1 Which of the following bytes have an error following data transmission?
  a) 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1   even parity used
  b) 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1   even parity used

  c) 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0   even parity used
  d) 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0   odd parity used
  e) 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1   odd parity used
2 In each case where an error occurs, can you work out which bit is incorrect?

Naturally, any of the bits in the above example could have been changed leading to a
transmission error. Therefore, even though an error has been flagged, it is impossible to know
exactly which bit is in error.
One of the ways around this problem is to use parity blocks. In this method, a block of data is
sent and the number of 1-bits are totalled horizontally and vertically (in other words, a parity
check is done in both horizontal and vertical directions). As the following example shows, this
method not only identifies that an error has occurred but also indicates where the error is.
In this example, nine bytes of data have been transmitted. Agreement has been made that even
parity will be used. Another byte, known as the parity byte, has also been sent. This byte
consists entirely of the parity bits produced by the vertical parity check. The parity byte also
indicates the end of the block of data.
Table 6.2 shows how the data arrived at the receiving end:

Table 6.2

A careful study of the table shows that
• byte 8 (row 8) has incorrect parity (there are three 1-bits)
• bit 5 (column 5) also has incorrect parity (there are five 1-bits).
First, the table shows that an error has occurred following data transmission.
Second, at the intersection of row 8 and column 5, the position of the incorrect bit value (which
caused the error) can be found. This means that byte 8 should have been:

which would also correct column 5 giving an even vertical parity (now has four 1-bits).
This byte could, therefore, be corrected automatically, as shown above, or an error message
could be relayed back to the sender asking them to re-transmit the block of data. One final point;
if two of the bits change value following data transmission, it may be impossible to locate the
error using the above method.
For example, using the above example again:

This byte could reach the destination as:

All three are clearly incorrect, but they have retained even parity so will not trigger an error
message at the receiving end. Clearly, other methods to complement parity when it comes to
error checking of transmitted data are required (such as checksum).
Automatic repeat request (ARQ)
Automatic repeat request (ARQ) is another method to check data following data transmission.
This method can be summarised as follows:
• ARQ uses acknowledgement (a message sent to the receiver indicating that data has been
  received correctly) and timeout (the time interval allowed to elapse before an
  acknowledgement is received).
• When the receiving device detects an error following data transmission, it asks for the data
  packet to be re-sent.
• If no error is detected, a positive acknowledgement is sent to the sender.
• The sending device will re-send the data package if
  – it receives a request to re-send the data, or
  – a timeout has occurred.
• The whole process is continuous until the data packet received is correct or until the ARQ time
  limit (timeout) is reached.
• ARQ is often used by mobile phone networks to guarantee data integrity.

ACTIVITY 6B
1 The following block of data was received after transmission from a remote computer; odd
  parity was being used by both sender and receiver.
  One of the bits has been changed during the transmission stage.
  Locate where this error is and suggest a corrected byte value:

2 a) A company is collecting data about new customers and is using an online form to collect
     the data, as shown below.
     Describe a suitable validation check for each of the four groups of fields.

  b) Explain the differences between validation and verification.
      Why are both methods used to maintain the integrity of data?
3 A shopkeeper is populating a database containing information about goods for sale in their
  shop.
  They are entering the data manually, using both validation and verification to ensure the
  integrity of the entered data.
  Here is an example of a record:

  a) Describe how verification could be used to ensure the accuracy of the entered data.
  b) Describe suitable validation checks for all four fields and give examples of data which

      would fail your chosen validation methods.

1 A college is using a local area network (LAN) to access data from a database.
  a) Give two security measures to protect the data on the college’s computer system.
                                                                                               [2]
  b) Data regarding new students joining the college is being entered into the database.
     Each student has a 7-digit identification number (ID).
     A check digit is used as a form of checking to ensure errors have not been made when
     entering the ID numbers. The verification routine uses modulo-11 with the check digit as
     the eighth (right-most) digit.
     The weightings used to calculate the check digit are: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1; the value 7 is
     the multiplier for the left-most digit.
     The ID number is:        1563412
     Calculate the check digit.
                                                                                                [4]
  c) Name and describe two validation checks that could be carried out on the student ID
     number.
                                                                                                [4]
2 a) Explain what antivirus software is and how it can be used to ensure data security.
                                                                                                [4]
  b) Explain how a firewall can be used to identify illegal attempts at accessing a computer
     system and how they can be used to keep data safe.
                                                                                                [4]

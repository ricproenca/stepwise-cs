2.1.1 Networking devices
One of the earliest forms of networking, circa 1970 in the USA, was the Advanced Research
Projects Agency Network (ARPAnet). This was an early form of packet switching wide area
network (WAN) connecting a number of large computers in the Department of Defense. It later
expanded to include university computers. It is generally agreed that ARPAnet developed the
technical platform for what we now call the internet. Figure 2.1 shows the vast area this network
covered.

Figure 2.1 ARPAnet coverage, 1973

As personal computers developed through the 1980s, a local network began to appear. This
became known as a LAN local area network (LAN). LANs tended to be much smaller
networks (usually inside one building) connecting a number of computers and shared devices,
such as printers. WANs typically consist of a number of LANs connected via public
communications networks (such as telephone lines or satellites). Because a WAN consists of
LANs joined together, it may be a private network, and passwords and user IDs are required to
access it. This is in contrast to the internet which is a vast number of decentralised networks and
computers which have a common point of access, so that anyone with access to the internet can
connect to the computers on these networks. This makes it intrinsically different to a WAN.
In recent years, another type of network – a metropolitan area network (MAN) – has emerged.
MANs are larger than LANs as they can connect together many small computer networks (e.g
LANs) housed in different buildings within a city (for example, a university campus). MANs are
restricted in their size geographically to, for example, a single city.
In contrast, WANs can cover a much larger geographical area, such as a country or a continent.
For example, a multi-national company may connect a number of smaller networks together (e.g.
LANs or MANs) to form a world-wide WAN. This is covered in more detail later.
Here are some of the main benefits of networking computers and devices (rather than using a
number of stand-alone computers):

• Devices, such as printers, can be shared (thus reducing costs).
• Licences to run software on networks are often far cheaper than buying licences for an
  equivalent number of stand-alone computers.
• Users can share files and data.
• Access to reliable data that comes from a central source, such as a file server.
• Data and files can be backed up centrally at the end of each day.
• Users can communicate using email and instant messaging.
• A network manager can oversee the network and, for example, apply access rights to certain
  files, or restrict access to external networks, such as the internet.
There are also a number of drawbacks:
• Cabling and servers can be an expensive initial outlay.
• Managing a large network can be a complex and difficult task.
• A breakdown of devices, such as the file servers, can affect the whole network.
• Malware and hacking can affect entire networks (particularly if a LAN is part of a much larger
  WAN), although firewalls do afford some protection in this respect.

Networked computers
Networked computers form an infrastructure which enables internal and external
communications to take place. The infrastructure includes the following:
Hardware
• LAN cards
• routers
• switches
• wireless routers
• cabling
Software
• operation and management of the network
• operation of firewalls
• security applications/utilities
Services
• DSL
• satellite communication channels
• wireless protocols
• IP addressing.
Networks can be categorised as private or public.
Private networks are owned by a single company or organisation (they are often LANs or
intranets with restricted user access, for example, passwords and user ids are required to join the
network); the companies are responsible for the purchase of their own equipment and software,
maintenance of the network and the hiring and training of staff.

Public networks are owned by a communications carrier company (such as a telecoms
company); many organisations will use the network and there are usually no specific password
requirements to enter the network – but sub-networks may be under security management.

WANs and LANs
Local area networks (LANs)
LANs are usually contained within one building, or within a small geographical area. A typical
LAN consists of a number of computers and devices (such as printers) connected to hubs or
switches. One of the hubs or switches is usually connected to a router and/or modem to allow
the LAN to connect to the internet or become part of a wide area network (WAN).
Wireless LANs (WLANs)
Wireless LANs (WLANs) are similar to LANs but there are no wires or cables. In other words,
they provide wireless network communications over fairly short distances (up to 100 metres)
using radio or infrared signals instead of using cables.
Devices, known as wireless access points (WAPs), are connected into the wired network at
fixed locations. Because of the limited range, most commercial LANs (such as those on a college
campus or at an airport) need several WAPs to permit uninterrupted wireless communications.
The WAPs use either spread spectrum technology (which is a wideband radio frequency with a
range from a few metres to 100 metres) or infrared (which has a very short range of about 1 to 2
metres and is easily blocked, and therefore has limited use; see Section 2.1.5 Wired and wireless
networking).
The WAP receives and transmits data between the WLAN and the wired network structure. End
users access the WLAN through wireless LAN adapters which are built into the devices or as a
plug in module.

Figure 2.2 Wireless local area networks (WLAN)

Wide area networks (WANs)

Wide area networks (WANs) are used when computers or networks are situated a long distance
from each other (for example, they may be in different cities or on different continents). If a
number of LANs are joined together using a router or modem, they can form a WAN. The
network of automated teller machines (ATMs) used by banks is one of the most common
examples of the use of a WAN.
Because of the long distances between devices, WANs usually make use of a public
communications network (such as telephone lines or satellites), but they can use dedicated or
leased communication lines which can be less expensive and more secure (less risk of hacking,
for example).
A typical WAN will consist of end systems and intermediate systems, as shown in Figure 2.3. 1,
3, 7 and 10 are known as end systems, and the remainder are known as intermediate systems.
The distance between each system can be considerable, especially if the WAN is run by a multi-
national company.

Figure 2.3 A typical WAN

The following is used as a guide for deciding the ‘size’ of a network:
WAN: 100 km to over 1000 km
MAN: 1 km to 100 km
LAN: 10 m to 1000 m
PAN: 1 m to 10 m (this is not a commonly used term – it means personal area network; in
       other words, a home system)

2.1.2 Client-server and peer-to-peer networking models
We will consider two types of networking models, client-server and peer-to-peer.

Client-server model

Figure 2.4 Client-server model

• The client-server model uses separate dedicated servers and specific client workstations;
  client computers will be connected to the server computer(s).
• Users are able to access most of the files, which are stored on dedicated servers.
• The server dictates which users are able to access which files. (Note: sharing of data is the
  most important part of the client-server model; with peer-to-peer, connectivity is the most
  important aspect.)
• The client-server model allows the installation of software onto a client’s computer.
• The model uses central security databases which control access to the shared resources. (Note:
  passwords and user IDs are required to log into the network.)
• Once a user is logged into the system, they will have access to only those resources (such as a
  printer) and files assigned to them by the network administrator, so offers greater security than
  peer-to-peer networks.
• Client-server networks can be as large as you want them to be and they are much easier to
  scale up than peer-to-peer networks.
• A central server looks after the storing, delivery and sending of emails.
• This model offers the most stable system, for example, if someone deletes a shared resource
  from the server, the nightly back-up would restore the deleted resource (this is different in
  peer-to-peer – see later).
• Client-server networks can become bottlenecked if there are several client requests at the same
  time.

• In the client-server model, a file server is used and is responsible for
   – central storage and management of data files, thus enabling other network users to access
     files
   – allowing users to share information without the need for offline devices (such as a memory
     stick)
   – allowing any computer to be configured as the host machine and act as the file server (note
     that the server could be a storage device (such as SSD or HDD) that could also serve as a
     remote storage device for other computers, thus allowing them to access this device as if it
     were a local storage device attached to their computer).

Examples of use of client-server network model
A company/user would choose a client-server network model for the following reasons.
• The company/user has a large user-base (however, it should be pointed out that this type of
  network model may still be used by a small group of people who are doing independent
  projects but need to have sharing of data and access to data outside the group).
• Access to network resources needs to be properly controlled.
• There is a need for good network security.
• The company requires its data to be free from accidental loss (in other words, data needs to be
  backed up at a central location).
An example is the company Amazon; it uses the client-server network model. The user front-end
is updated every time a user logs on to the Amazon website and a large server architecture
handles items such as order processing, billing customers and data security; none of the Amazon
users are aware that other customers are using the website at the same time – there is no
interaction between users and server since they are kept entirely separate at all times.

Peer-to-peer model

Figure 2.5 Peer-to-peer model

On a peer-to-peer network, each node joins the network to allow
• the provision of services to all other network users; the services available are listed on a
  nominated ‘look up’ computer – when a node requests a service, the ‘look up’ computer is
  contacted to find out which of the other network nodes can provide the required service
• other users on the network to simply access data from another node
• communication with other peers connected to the network
• peers to be both suppliers and consumers (unlike the client-server model where consumers and
  resources are kept entirely separate from each other)
• peers to participate as equals on the network (again this is different to the client-server model
  where a webserver and client have different responsibilities).
The peer-to-peer model does not have a central server. Each of the nodes (workstations) on the
network can share its files with all the other nodes, and each of the nodes will have its own data.
Because there is no central storage, there is no requirement to authenticate users.
This model is used in scenarios where no more than 10 nodes are required (such as a small
business) where it is relatively easy for users to be in contact with each other on a regular basis.
More than 10 nodes leads to performance and management issues.
Peer-to-peer offers little data security since there is no central security system. This means it is
impossible to know who is authorised to share certain data. Users can create their own network
node share point which is the only real security aspect since this gives them some kind of
control. However, there are no real authentication procedures.

Examples of peer-to-peer network model
A user would choose the peer-to-peer network model for one or more of following reasons:
• The network of users is fairly small.
• There is no need for robust security.
• They require workstation-based applications rather than being server-based.
An example would be a small business where there is frequent user interaction and there is no
need to have the features of a client-server network (for example, a builder with five associated
workers located in their own homes who only need access to each other’s diaries, previous jobs,
skills-base and so on – when the builder is commissioned to do a job they need to access each
other’s computer to check on who is available and who has the appropriate skills).

Thin clients and thick clients
The client-server model offers thin clients and thick clients. These can often refer to both
hardware and software.
Thin client
A thin client is heavily dependent on having access to a server to allow constant access to files
and to allow applications to run uninterrupted. A thin client can either be a device or software
which needs to be connected to a powerful computer or server to allow processing to take place
(the computer or server could be on the internet or could be part of a LAN/MAN/WAN
network). The thin client will not work unless it is connected at all times to the computer or
server. A software example would be a web browser which has very limited functions unless it is
connected to a server. Other examples include mobile phone apps which need constant access to
a server to work. A hardware example is a POS terminal at a supermarket that needs constant
access to a server to find prices, charge customers and to do any significant processing.
Thick client
A thick client can either be a device or software that can work offline or online; it is still able to
do some processing whether it is connected to a server or not. A thick client can either be
connected to a LAN/MAN/WAN, virtual network, the internet or a cloud computing server. A
hardware example is a normal PC/laptop/tablet since it would have its own storage (HDD or
SSD), RAM and operating system which means it is capable of operating effectively online or
offline. An example of software is a computer game which can run independently on a user’s
computer, but can also connect to an online server to allow gamers to play and communicate
with each other.
Table 2.1 highlights some of the pros and cons of using thick client or thin client hardware.

          Pros                                    Cons
 Thick • more robust (device can carry            • less secure (relies on clients to keep their own
 clients   out processing even when not             data secure)
           connected to server)                   • each client needs to update data and software
         • clients have more control (they          individually
           can store their own programs

                and data/files)                                • data integrity issues, since many clients access
                                                                 the same data which can lead to
                                                                 inconsistencies

 Thin • less expensive to expand (low-                         • high reliance on the server; if the server goes
 clients   powered and cheap devices can                         down or there is a break in the communication
           be used)                                              link then the devices cannot work
         • all devices are linked to a server                  • despite cheaper hardware, the start-up costs
           (data updates and new software                        are generally higher than for thick clients
           installation done centrally)
         • server can offer protection
           against hacking and malware

Table 2.1 Summary of pros and cons of thick and thin client hardware

Table 2.2 highlights the differences between thick and thin client software.

 Thin client software                                                  Thick client software

   server or computer for it to work                                     software even when not connected to a

 • requires very few local resources (such as                          • relies heavily on local resources
   SSD, RAM memory or computer processing
   time)

 • relies on a good, stable and fast network                           • more tolerant of a slow network

2.1.3 Network topologies
There are many ways to connect computers to make complex networks. Here we will consider
• bus networks
• star networks
• mesh networks
• hybrid networks.

Bus networks
A bus network topology uses a single central cable to which all computers and devices are
connected. It is easy to expand and requires little cabling. Data can only travel in one direction; if
data is being sent between devices then other devices cannot transmit. Terminators are needed at
each end to prevent signal reflection (bounce). Bus networks are typically peer-to-peer. The
disadvantages of a bus network include:
• If the main cable fails, the whole network goes down.
• The performance of the network deteriorates under heavy loading.
• The network is not secure since each packet passes through every node.
The advantages of a bus network include:
• Even if one node fails, the remainder of the network continues to function.
• It is easy to increase the size of the network by adding additional nodes.

Figure 2.6 Bus network topology

In bus network topology, each node looks at each packet and determines whether or not the
address of the recipient in the package matches the node address. If so, the node accepts the
packet; if not, the packet is ignored.
These are most suitable for situations with a small number of devices with light traffic occurring.
For example, a small company or an office environment.

Star networks
A star network topology uses a central hub/switch and each computer/device is connected to
the hub/switch. Data going from host to host is directed through the central hub/switch. Each
computer/device has its own dedicated connection to the central node (hub/switch) – any type of
network cable can be used for the connections (see Section 2.1.5 Wired and wireless
networking). This type of network is typically a client-server. The disadvantages of a star
network include:
• The initial installation costs are high.

• If the central hub/switch fails, then the whole network goes down.
The advantages of a star network include:
• Data collisions are greatly reduced due to the topology.
• It is a more secure network since security methods can be applied to the central node and
  packets only travel to nodes with the correct address.
• It is easy to improve by simply installing an upgraded hub.
• If one of the connections is broken it only affects one of the nodes.
How packets are handled depends on whether the central node is a switch or a hub. If it is a hub,
all the packets will be sent to every device/node on the star network – if the address in the packet
matches that of the node, it will be accepted; otherwise, it is ignored (this is similar to the way
packets are handled on a bus network). If the central node is a switch, packets will only be sent
to nodes where the address matches the recipient address in the packet. The latter is clearly more
secure, since only nodes intended to see the packet will receive it.

Figure 2.7 Star network topology

Star networks are useful for evolving networks where devices are frequently added or removed.
They are well suited to applications where there is heavy data traffic.

Mesh networks
There are two types of mesh network topologies: routing and flooding. Routing works by
giving the nodes routing logic (in other words, they act like a router) so that data is directed to its
destination by the shortest route and can be re-routed if one of the nodes in the route has failed.
Flooding simply sends the data via all the nodes and uses no routing logic, which can lead to
unnecessary loading on the network. It is a type of peer-to-peer network, but is fundamentally
different. The disadvantages of a mesh network include:
• A large amount of cabling is needed, which is expensive and time consuming.
• Set-up and maintenance is difficult and complex.
The advantages of a mesh network include:
• It is easy to identify where faults on the network have occurred.
• Any broken links in the network do not affect the other nodes.
• Good privacy and security, since packets travel along dedicated routes.
• The network is relatively easy to expand.

Figure 2.8 Mesh network topology

There are a number of applications worth considering here:
• The internet and WANs/MANs are typical uses of mesh networks.
• Many examples include industrial monitoring and control where sensors are set up in mesh
  design and feedback to a control system which is part of the mesh, for example
  – medical monitoring of patients in a hospital
  – electronics interconnectivity (for example, systems that link large screen televisions, DVDs,
    set top boxes, and so on); each device will be in a location forming the mesh
  – modern vehicles use wireless mesh network technology to enable the monitoring and
    control of many of the components in the vehicle.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 2A
There appear to be similarities between the peer-to-peer network model and mesh network
model.
Describe the differences between the two models.

Hybrid networks
A hybrid network is a mixture of two or more different topologies (bus and star, bus and mesh,
and so on). The main advantages and disadvantages depend on which types of network are used
to make up the hybrid network, but an additional disadvantage is that they can be very complex
to install, configure and maintain.
Additional advantages include:
• They can handle large volumes of traffic.
• It is easy to identify where a network fault has occurred.
• They are very well suited to the creation of larger networks.

Figure 2.9 Hybrid bus and star network

Note that the handling of packets in hybrid networks will depend on which of the above
topologies are used to make up the hybrid structure.
One of the typical applications of hybrid networks is illustrated by the following example,
involving three hotel chains, A, B and C.
Suppose hotel chain A uses a bus network, hotel chain B uses a star network and hotel chain C
uses a mesh network.
At some point, all three hotel chains are taken over by another company. By using hybrid
network technology, all three hotel chains can be connected together even though they are each
using a different type of network. The system can also be expanded easily without affecting any
of the existing hotels using the network.
There are many other examples; you might want to explore the various applications for each type
of network topology.

2.1.4 Public and private cloud computing
Cloud storage is a method of data storage where data is stored on offsite servers – the physical
storage covers hundreds of servers in many locations. The same data is stored on more than one
server in case of maintenance or repair, allowing clients to access data at any time. This is known
as data redundancy. The physical environment is owned and managed by a hosting company.
There are three common systems, public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud.
Public cloud is a storage environment where the customer/client and cloud storage provider are
different companies.
Private cloud is storage provided by a dedicated environment behind a company firewall.
Customer/client and cloud storage provider are integrated and operate as a single entity.
Hybrid cloud is a combination of private and public clouds. Some data resides in the private
cloud and less sensitive/less commercial data can be accessed from a public cloud storage
provider.
Instead of saving data on a local hard disk or other storage device, a user can save their data ‘in
the cloud’. The pros and cons of using cloud storage are shown in Table 2.3.

Table 2.3 Summary of pros and cons of using cloud storage

Data security when using cloud storage
Companies that transfer vast amounts of confidential data from their own systems to a cloud
service provider are effectively relinquishing control of their own data security. This raises a
number of questions:
• What physical security exists regarding the building where the data is housed?
• How good is the cloud service provider’s resistance to natural disasters or power cuts?
• What safeguards exist regarding personnel who work for the cloud service company? Can they

  use their authorisation codes to access confidential data for monetary purposes?

Potential data loss when using cloud storage
There is a risk that important and irreplaceable data could be lost from the cloud storage
facilities. Actions from hackers (gaining access to accounts or pharming attacks, for example)
could lead to loss or corruption of data. Users need to be certain sufficient safeguards exist to
overcome these risks.
The following breaches of security involving some of the largest cloud service providers suggest
why some people are nervous of using cloud storage for important files:
• The XEN security threat, which forced several cloud operators to reboot all their cloud servers,
  was caused by a problem in the XEN hypervisor (a hypervisor is a piece of computer software,
  firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines).
• A large cloud service provider permanently lost data during a routine back-up procedure.
• The celebrity photos cloud hacking scandal, in which more than 100 private photos of
  celebrities were leaked. Hackers had gained access to a number of cloud accounts, which then
  enabled them to publish the photos on social networks and sell them to publishing companies.
• In 2016, the National Electoral Institute of Mexico suffered a cloud security breach in which
  93 million voter registrations, stored on a central database, were compromised and became
  publicly available to everyone. To make matters worse, much of the information on this
  database was also linked to an Amazon cloud server outside Mexico.

Cloud software
Cloud storage is, of course, only one aspect of cloud computing. Other areas covered by cloud
computing include databases, networking, software and analytical services using the internet.
Here we will consider cloud software – you can research for yourself how databases and
analytical services are provided by cloud computing services.
Software applications can be delivered to a user’s computer on demand using cloud computing
services. The cloud provider will both host and manage software applications – this will include
maintenance, software upgrades and security for a monthly fee. A user will simply connect to the
internet (using their web browser on a computer or tablet or mobile phone) and contact their
cloud services supplier. The cloud services supplier will connect them to the software application
they require.
The main advantages are that the software will be fully tested and it does not need to reside on
the user’s device. However, the user can still use the software even if the internet connection is
lost. Data will simply be stored on the local device and then data will be uploaded or downloaded
once the internet connection is restored.
Cloud-based applications can, therefore, perform tasks on a local device. This makes them
fundamentally different to web-based apps which need an internet connection at all times.

2.1.5 Wired and wireless networking
Wireless
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth offer wireless communication between devices. They both use
electromagnetic radiation as the carrier of data transmission.
Bluetooth sends and receives radio waves in a band of 79 different frequencies (known as
channels). These are all centred on a 2.45 GHz frequency. Devices using Bluetooth automatically
detect and connect to each other, but they do not interfere with other devices since each
communicating pair uses a different channel (from the 79 options).
When a device wants to communicate, it picks one of the 79 channels at random. If the channel
is already being used, it randomly picks another channel. This is known as spread spectrum
frequency hopping. To further minimise the risks of interference with other devices, the
communication pairs constantly change the frequencies (channels) they are using (several times a
second). Bluetooth creates a secure wireless personal area network (WPAN) based on key
encryption.
Bluetooth is useful when
• transferring data between two or more devices which are less than 30 metres apart
• the speed of data transmission is not critical
• using low bandwidth applications (for example, sending music files from a mobile phone to a
  headset).
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, Wi-Fi also uses spread spectrum technology. However, Wi-
Fi is best suited to operating full-scale networks, since it offers much faster data transfer rates,
better range and better security than Bluetooth. A Wi-Fi-enabled device (such as a computer or
smart phone) can access, for example, the internet wirelessly at any wireless access point (WAP)
or ‘hot spot’ up to 100 metres away.
As mentioned, wireless connectivity uses electromagnetic radiation: radio waves, microwaves or
infrared. The scale of frequency and wavelength of magnetic radiation is shown in Table 2.4.

Table 2.4 Frequency and wavelength of magnetic radiation

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 2B
Frequency and wavelength are linked by the equation:

where f = frequency (m), λ = wavelength (Hz), and c = velocity of light (3 × 108 m/s).
Confirm the frequency values in Table 2.3 using the wavelengths given.

Table 2.5 compares radio waves, microwaves and infrared. (Please note: the ‘>’ symbol in the
table means ‘better than’).

 Bandwidth                       infrared > microwaves > radio waves
                                 (infrared has the largest bandwidth)
 Penetration                     radio waves > microwaves > infrared
                                 (radio waves have the best penetration)
 Attenuation                     radio waves > microwaves > infrared
                                 (radio waves have the best attenuation)
Table 2.5 Comparison of radio waves, microwaves and infrared

Penetration measures the ability of the electromagnetic radiation to pass through different media.
Attenuation is the reduction in amplitude of a signal (infrared has low attenuation because it can
be affected by, for example, rain or internal walls). Thus, we would expect infrared to be suitable
for indoor use only; the fact that it can be stopped by walls is seen as an advantage since this
stops the signal causing interference elsewhere. Microwaves seem to offer the best compromise,
since they support reasonable bandwidth, and have reasonable penetration and attenuation.

Additional notes on the use of satellites
The use of microwaves and radio waves was previously mentioned as a method for allowing Wi-
Fi connectivity in networks. These methods are perfectly satisfactory for short distances – the
electromagnetic waves carry the signals – but the curvature of the Earth prevents such methods
transmitting data globally.

Figure 2.10

To overcome this problem, we need to adopt satellite technology:

Figure 2.11

The communication between antennae and satellite is carried out by radio waves or microwave
frequencies. Different frequency bands are used to prevent signal interference and to allow
networks spread across the Earth to communicate through use of satellites (many satellites orbit
the Earth – refer to Section 2.2.2 for more information on use of satellite technology with
networks).

Wired
There are three main types of cable used in wired networks (see Figure 2.12).

Figure 2.12 (left to right) Twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, fibre optic cable

Twisted pair cables
Twisted pair cables are the most common cable type used in LANs. However, of the three types
of cable, it has the lowest data transfer rate and suffers the most from external interference (such
as electromagnetic radiation). However, it is the cheapest option. There are two types of twisted
pair cable: unshielded and shielded. Unshielded is used by residential users. Shielded is used
commercially (the cable contains a thin metal foil jacket which cancels out some of the external
interference).
Coaxial cables
Coaxial cables are the most commonly used cables in MANs and by cable television companies.
The cost of coaxial cables is higher than twisted pair cables but they offer a better data transfer
rate and are affected less by external interference. Coaxial cables also have about 80 times the

transmission capacity of twisted pair. Coaxial suffers from the greatest signal attenuation, but
offers the best anti-jamming capabilities.
Fibre optic cables
Fibre optic cables are most commonly used to send data over long distances, because they offer
the best data transfer rate, the smallest signal attenuation and have a very high resistance to
external interference. The main drawback is the high cost. Unlike the other two types of cable,
fibre optics use pulses of light rather than pulses of electricity to transmit data. They have about
26 000 times the transmission capacity of twisted pair cables.
Fibre optic cables can be single- or multi-mode.
Single-mode uses a single mode light source and has a smaller central core, which results in less
light reflection along the cable. This allows the data to travel faster and further, making them a
good choice for CATV and telecommunications.
Multi core allows for a multi-mode light source; the construction causes higher light reflections
in the core, so they work best over shorter distances (in a LAN, for example).

Wired versus wireless
Numerous factors should be considered when deciding if a network should use wired or wireless
connectivity, as listed below.
Wireless networking
• It is easier to expand networks and is not necessary to connect devices using cables.
• Devices have increased mobility, provided they are within range of the WAPs.
• Increased chance of interference from external sources.
• Data is less secure than with wired systems; it is easier to intercept radio waves and
  microwaves than cables so it is essential to protect data transmissions using encryption (such
  as WEP, WPA2).
• Data transmission rate is slower than wired networks (although it is improving).
• Signals can be stopped by thick walls (in old houses, for example) and signal strength can
  vary, or ‘drop out’.
Wired networking
• More reliable and stable network (wireless connectivity is often subjected to interference).
• Data transfer rates tend to be faster with no ‘dead spots’.
• Tends to be cheaper overall, in spite of the need to buy and install cable.
• Devices are not mobile; they must be close enough to allow for cable connections.
• Lots of wires can lead to tripping hazards, overheating of connections (potential fire risk) and
  disconnection of cables during routine office cleaning.
Other considerations
• If mobile phones and tablets are connected to the network, it will need to offer Wi-Fi or
  Bluetooth capability.
• There may be regulations in some countries regarding which wireless transmission frequencies

  can be used legally.
• Permission from authorities and land owners may be required before laying cables
  underground.
• There are numerous competing signals in the air around us; it is important to consider this
  when deciding whether to go for wired or wireless connectivity.

2.1.6 Hardware requirements of networks
In this section we will consider a number of hardware items needed to form a LAN network and
the hardware needed to form a WAN. Please note
• the concept of the WLAN and the hardware needed to support it have been covered in earlier
  sections
• the hardware items hub and gateway have been included in this section to complete the
  picture; however, knowledge of these two items is not required by the syllabus.

Hub
Hubs are hardware devices that can have a number of devices or computers connected to them.

Figure 2.13 Hub flow diagram

They are often used to connect a number of devices to form a local area network (LAN), for
example a star network (see Section 2.1.3). A hub’s main task is to take any data packet (a group
of data being transmitted) received at one of its ports and then send the data to every computer in
the network. Using hubs is not a very secure method of data distribution and is also wasteful of
bandwidth. Note that hubs can be wired or wireless devices.

Switch
Switches are similar to hubs, but are more efficient in the way they distribute the data packet. As
with hubs, they connect a number of devices or computers together to form a LAN (for example,
a star network).
However, unlike a hub, the switch checks the data packet received and works out its destination
address (or addresses) and sends the data to the appropriate computer(s) only. This makes using a
switch a more secure and efficient way of distributing data.

Figure 2.14 Switch flow diagram

Each device or computer on a network has a media access control (MAC) address which

identifies it uniquely. Data packets sent to switches will have a MAC address identifying the
source of the data and additional addresses identifying each device which should receive the
data. Note that switches can be wired or wireless devices.

Repeater
When signals are sent over long distances, they suffer attenuation or signal loss. Repeaters are
devices which are added to transmission systems to boost the signal so it can travel greater
distances. They amplify signals on both analogue (copper cable) and digital (fibre optic cable)
communication links.
Repeaters can also be used on wireless systems. These are used to boost signals to prevent any
‘dead spots’ in the Wi-Fi zone. These devices plug into electric wall sockets and send out booster
signals. They are termed non-logical devices because they will boost all signals which have been
detected; they are not selective.
Sometimes, hubs contain repeaters and are known as repeating hubs. All signals fed to the hub
are boosted before being sent to all devices in the network, thus increasing the operational range.
There are two main drawbacks of repeating hubs:
1 They have only one collision domain. When the signals are boosted and then broadcast to
  devices, any collisions which might occur are not resolved there and then. One way to deal
  with this problem is to make use of jamming signals – while this manages the collisions, it
  also reduces network performance since it involves repeated broadcasts as the collisions are
  resolved.
2 The devices are referred to as unmanaged since they are unable to manage delivery paths and
  also security in the network.

Bridge
Bridges are devices that connect one LAN to another LAN that uses the same protocol
(communication rules). They are often used to connect together different parts of a LAN so that
they can function as a single LAN.

Figure 2.15 Bridge flow diagram

Bridges are used to interconnect LANs (or parts of LANs), since sending out every data packet
to all possible destinations would quickly flood larger networks with unnecessary traffic. For this
reason, a router is used to communicate with other networks, such as the internet. Note that
bridges can be wired or wireless devices.

Router
Routers enable data packets to be routed between the different networks for example, to join a
LAN to a WAN. The router takes data transmitted in one format from a network (which is using
a particular protocol) and converts the data to a protocol and format understood by another
network, thereby allowing them to communicate via the router. We can, therefore, summarise the
role of routers as follows. Routers
• restrict broadcasts to a LAN
• act as a default gateway
• can perform protocol translation; for example, allowing a wired network to communicate with
  a wireless (Wi-Fi) network – the router can take an Ethernet data packet, remove the Ethernet
  part and put the IP address into a frame recognised by the wireless protocol (in other words, it
  is performing a protocol conversion)
• can move data between networks
• can calculate the best route to a network destination address.

Figure 2.16 Router flow diagram

Broadband routers sit behind a firewall. The firewall protects the computers on a network. The
router’s main function is to transmit internet and transmission protocols between two networks
and allow private networks to be connected.
The router inspects the data package sent to it from any computer on any of the networks
connected to it. Since every computer on the same network has the same part of an internet
protocol (IP) address, the router is able to send the data packet to the appropriate switch and it
will then be delivered using the MAC destination address (see next section). If the MAC address
doesn’t match any device on the network, it passes on to another switch on the same network
until the appropriate device is found. Routers can be wired or wireless devices.

Gateway
A gateway is a network point (or node) that acts as an entrance to another network. It is a key
point for data on its way to or from other networks. It can be used to connect two or more
dissimilar LANs (LANs using different protocols). The gateway converts data packets from one
protocol to another. Gateways can also act as routers, firewalls or servers – in other words, any
device that allows traffic to flow in and out of the networks. Gateways can be wired or wireless
devices.
All networks have boundaries so that all communication within the network is conducted using
devices such as switches or routers. If a network node needs to communicate outside its network,
it needs to use a gateway.

Modems
Modern computers work with digital data, whereas many of the public communication channels
still only allow analogue data transmission. To allow the transmission of digital data over
analogue communication channels we need to use a modem (modulator demodulator). This
device converts digital data to analogue data. It also does the reverse and converts data received
over the analogue network into digital data which can be understood by the computer.
Wireless modems transmit data in a modulated form to allow several simultaneous wireless
communications to take place without interfering with each other. A modem will connect to the
public infrastructure (cable, telephone, fibre-optics or satellite) and will supply the user with a
standard Ethernet output which allows connection to a router, thus enabling an internet
connection to occur.

Figure 2.17 Wireless modem flow diagram

While the router will allow the creation of a network in a home, for example, the modem allows
for the connection to the external networks (for example, the internet). Routers and modems can
be combined into one unit; these devices have the electronics and software to provide both router
and modem functions.
Another example of a modem is a softmodem (software modem), which uses minimal hardware
and uses software that runs on the host computer. The computer’s resources (mainly the
processor and RAM) replace the hardware of a conventional modem.
Table 2.6 shows the differences between routers and gateways.

 Routers                                                 Gateways

 • forward packets of data from one network to           • convert one protocol (or data
   another; routers read each incoming packet of data      format) to another protocol (format)
   and decide where to forward the packet                  used in a different network

 • can route traffic from one network to another         • convert data packets from one
   network                                                 protocol to another; they act as an
                                                           entry and exit point to networks

 • can be used to join LANs together to form a WAN       • translate from one protocol to
   (sometimes called brouters) and also to connect a       another
   number of LANs to the internet

 • offer additional features such as dynamic routing     • do not support dynamic routing
   (ability to forward data by different routes)

Table 2.6 Differences between routers and gateways

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 2C
Draw a diagram to show how a gateway could be used to connect together three LANs which
are using different protocols. Include all the hardware devices and cables needed.

Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card (NIC) is needed to allow a device to connect to a network (such as
the internet). It is usually part of the device hardware and frequently contains the MAC address
generated at the manufacturing stage.

Wireless network interface card/controller (WNIC)
Wireless network interface cards/controllers (WNICs) are the same as the more ordinary
NICs, in that they are used to connect devices to the internet or other networks. They use an
antenna to communicate with networks via microwaves and normally simply plug into a USB
port or can be internal integrated circuit plug in.

Figure 2.18 Wireless network interface card/controller (WNIC)

As with usual NICs, they work on layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model (refer to Chapter 14 for more
details). WNICs work in two modes.
Infrastructure mode requires WAPs (wireless access points) and all the data is transferred
using the WAP and hub/switch; all the wireless devices connect to the WAP and must use the
same security and authentication techniques.
Ad hoc mode does not need to have access to WAPs; it is possible for devices to interface with
each other directly.

2.1.7 Ethernet
Ethernet is a protocol used by many wired LANs. It was adopted as a standard by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and Ethernet is also known as IEEE 802.3. A
network using Ethernet is made up of:
• a node (any device on the LAN)
• medium (path used by the LAN devices, such as an Ethernet cable)
• frame (data is transmitted in frames which are made up of source address and destination
  address – the addresses are often the MAC address).

Conflicts
When using Ethernet, it is possible for IP addresses to conflict; this could show up as a warning
such as that in Figure 2.19.

Figure 2.19 IP address conflict error

This may occur if devices on the same network have been given the same IP address; without a
unique IP address it is not possible to connect to a network. This is most likely to occur on a
LAN where dynamic IP addresses may have been used. Dynamic IP addresses are temporary and
may have been assigned to a device on the network, unfortunately, another device using static IP
addresses may already have the same IP address. This can be resolved by re-starting the router.
Any dynamic IP addresses will be re-assigned, which could resolve the issue.

Collisions
Ethernet supports broadcast transmission (communications where pieces of data are sent from
sender to receiver) and are used to send messages to all devices connected to a LAN. The risk is
that two messages using the same data channel could be sent at the same time, leading to a
collision. Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) was developed
to try and resolve this issue. Collison detection depends on simple physics: when a frame is sent
it causes a voltage change on the Ethernet cable. When a collision is detected, a node stops
transmitting a frame and transmits a ‘jam’ signal and then waits for a random time interval
before trying to resend the frame. CSMA/CD protocol will define the random time period for a
device to wait before trying again.

Figure 2.20 shows how data collisions can be dealt with using transmission counters (which keep
track of how many times the collision detection routine has been entered – there will a defined
limit as part of the CSMA/CD protocol) and random time periods.

Figure 2.20 How data collisions can be dealt with using transmission counters

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 2D
Review Figure 2.20. As it stands, it is possible for an endless loop to be established.
Suggest a modification to the flow diagram to ensure it terminates if there is a problem with
the data channel, or to prevent the data transmission holding up the computer for an
unacceptable time period.

2.1.8 Bit streaming
Bit streaming is a contiguous sequence of digital bits sent over the internet or a network that
requires a high speed data communication link (such as fast broadband). Since bit streaming
often involves very large files (such as video) it is necessary for the files to undergo some data
compression before transmission. It is also necessary to have some form of buffering to ensure
smooth playback of the media files.
The data transmission rate from the file server (containing the video, for example) to the buffer
must be greater than the rate at which data is transmitted from buffer to media player. The larger
the buffer, the better the control over the bit rate being sent to the media player. The media
player will always check to ensure data lies between a minimum value (often referred to as low
water mark) and a maximum value (often referred to as a high water mark). The difference
between the two values is usually about 80% of the total buffer capacity. The buffer is a
temporary storage area of the computer.

Figure 2.21 Bit streaming

Table 2.7 shows the pros and cons of bit streaming.

 Pros of bit streaming                     Cons of bit streaming

 • no need to wait for a whole video       • cannot stream video or music files if broadband
   or music file to be downloaded            connection is lost
   before the user can watch or listen     • video or music files will pause to allow the data
 • no need to store large files on your      being streamed to ‘catch up’ if there is insufficient
   device                                    buffer capacity or slow broadband connection
 • allows video files and music files      • streaming uses up a lot of bandwidth
   to be played on demand (as              • security risks associated with downloading files
   required)                                 from the internet
 • no need for any specialist hardware     • copyright issues
 • affords piracy protection (more
   difficult to copy streamed files than
   files stored on a hard drive)

Table 2.7 Pros and cons of bit streaming

Bit streaming can be either on demand or real time.

On demand

• Digital files stored on a server are converted to a bit streaming format (encoding takes place
  and the encoded files are uploaded to a server).
• A link to the encoded video/music file is placed on the web server to be downloaded.
• The user clicks on the link and the video/music file is downloaded in a contiguous bit stream.
• Because it is on demand, the streamed video/music is broadcast to the user as and when
  required.
• It is possible to pause, rewind and fast forward the video/music if required.

Real time
• An event is captured by camera and microphone and is sent to a computer.
• The video signal is converted (encoded) to a streaming media file.
• The encoded file is uploaded from the computer to the dedicated video streaming server.
• The server sends the encoded live video to the user’s device.
• Since the video footage is live it is not possible to pause, rewind or fast forward.

2.2.1 The differences between the internet and the
World Wide Web
There are fundamental differences between the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

Internet
• The internet is a massive network of networks (although, as explained in Section 2.1.1, the
  internet is not a WAN) which are made up of various computers and other electronic devices.
• It stands for interconnected network.
• The internet makes use of transmission control protocol (TCP)/internet protocol (IP).

World Wide Web (WWW)
• This is a collection of multimedia web pages and other documents which are stored on
  websites.
• http(s) protocols are written using HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML).
• Uniform resource locators (URLs) specify the location of all web pages.
• Web resources are accessed by web browsers.
• The world wide web uses the internet to access information from servers and other computers.

2.2.2 Hardware and software needed to support the
internet
The fundamental requirements for connecting to the internet are
• a device (such as a computer, tablet or mobile phone)
• a telephone line connection or a mobile phone network connection (however, it is possible that
  a tablet or mobile phone may connect to the internet using a wireless router)
• a router (which can be wired or wireless) or router and modem
• an internet service provider (ISP) (combination of hardware and software)
• a web browser.
The telephone network system, public switched telephone network (PSTN), is used to connect
computers/devices and LANs between towns and cities. Satellite technology is used to connect to
other countries (see later).
In recent years, telephone lines have changed from copper cables to fibre optic cables, which
permits greater bandwidth and faster data transfer rates (and less risk of data corruption from
interference). Fibre optic telephone networks are usually identified as ‘fast broadband’. As
discussed earlier, high speed broadband has allowed WLANs to be developed by using WAPs.
High speed communication links allow telephone and video calls to be made using a computer
and the internet. Telephone calls require either an internet-enabled telephone connected to a
computer (using a USB port) or external/internal microphone and speakers. Video calls also
require a webcam. When using the internet to make a phone call, the user’s voice is converted to
digital packages using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Data is split into packages (packet
switching) and sent over the network via the fastest route. Packet switching and circuit switching
are covered in more detail in Chapter 14.

Comparison between PSTN and internet when making a phone call
Public switched telephone network (PSTN)
PSTN uses a standard telephone connected to a telephone line.
The telephone line connection is always open whether or not anybody is talking – the link is not
terminated until the receivers are replaced by both parties.
Telephone lines remain active even during a power cut; they have their own power source.
Modern phones are digitised systems and use fibre optic cables (although because of the way it
works this is a big waste of capacity – a 10 minute phone call will transmit about 10 MB of
data).
Existing phone lines use circuit switching (when a phone call is made the connection (circuit) is
maintained throughout the duration of the call – this is the basis of PSTN).
Phone calls using the internet
Phone calls using the internet use either an internet phone or microphone and speakers (video
calls also require a webcam).

The internet connection is only ‘live’ while data (sound/video image) is being transmitted.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) converts sound to digital packages (encoding) which can be
sent over the internet.
VoIP uses packet switching; the networks simply send and retrieve data as it is needed so there is
no dedicated line, unlike PSTN. Data is routed through thousands of possible pathways, allowing
the fastest route to be determined.
The conversation (data) is split into data packages. Each packet contains at least the sender’s
address, receiver’s address and order number of packet – the sending computer sends the data to
its router which sends the packets to another router, and so on. At the receiving end, the packets
are reassembled into the original state (see Chapter 14 for more details).
VoIP also carries out file compression to reduce the amount of data being transmitted.
Because the link only exists while data is being transmitted, a typical 10 minute phone call may
only contain about 3 minutes where people are talking; thus only 3 MB of data is transmitted
making it much more efficient than PSTN.
Cellular networks and satellites
Other devices, such as mobile phones, use the cellular network. Here, the mobile phone
providers act as the ISPs and the phones contain communication software which allows them to
access the telephone network and also permits them to make an internet connection.
Satellites are an important part of all network communications that cover vast distances. Due to
the curvature of the Earth, the height of the satellite’s orbit determines how much coverage it can
give. Figure 2.22 shows how satellites are classified according to how high they orbit in relation
to the Earth’s surface.

Figure 2.22 Satellite classification

Satellites have the advantage that they will always give complete coverage and don’t suffer from
signal attenuation to the same extent as underground/undersea cables. It is also difficult to isolate
and resolve faults in cables on the sea bed.

2.2.3 IP addresses
The internet is based on TCP/IP protocols. Protocols define the rules that must be agreed by
senders and receivers on the internet. Protocols can be divided into TCP layers (see Chapter 14).
We will first consider internet protocols (IP).

Internet protocols (IP)
IPv4 addressing
The most common type of addressing on the internet is IPv4 IP version 4 (IPv4). This is based
on 32 bits giving 232 (4 294 967 296) possible addresses. The 32 bits are split into four groups of
8 bits (thus giving a range of 0 to 255). For example, 254.0.128.77.
The system uses the group of bits to define network (netID) and network host (hostID). The
netID allows for initial transmission to be routed according to the netID and then the hostID is
looked at by the receiving network. Networks are split into five different classes, as shown in
Table 2.8 below.

Table 2.8 The five network classes

Here the network ID is 29 and the host ID is 68.0.43 (made up of sub-net ID 68.0 and host ID of
43).
However, it soon became clear that this IPv4 system provides insufficient address range. For
example, a user with a medium sized network (class B) might have 284 host machines and their
class B licence allows them 216 (65534; note the value is not 65536 since two values are not
assigned). This means several of the allocated host IDs will not be used, which is wasteful.
Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) reduces this problem by increasing the flexibility of the
IPv4 system. A suffix is used, such as 192.30.250.00/18, which means 18 bits will be used for
the net ID and the last 14 bits will be used for the host ID (rather than the normal 24 bits and 8
bits for a class C network). The suffix clearly increases the flexibility regarding which bits
represent the net ID and which represent the host ID.

EXTENSION ACTIVITY 2E
Network address translation (NAT) removes the need for each IP address to be unique. Find
out how it works.

IPv6 addressing
IPv6 addressing has been developed to overcome some of the problems associated with IPv4.
This system uses 128-bit addressing, which allows for much more complex addressing
structures. An IPv6 address is broken into 16-bit chunks and because of this, it adopts the
hexadecimal notation. For example:

                        A8FB:7A88:FFF0:0FFF:3D21:2085:66FB:F0FA
Note how a colon (:) rather than a decimal point (.) is used here.
It has been designed to allow the internet to grow in terms of number of hosts and the potential
amount of data traffic. IPv6 has benefits over IPv4, it
• has no need for NATs (network address translation)
• removes risk of private IP address collisions
• has built in authentication
• allows for more efficient routing.

Zero compression
IPv6 addresses can be quite long; but there is a way to shorten them using zero compression.
For example, 900B:3E4A:AE41:0000:0000:AFF7:DD44:F1FF can be written as:

                              900B:3E4A:AE41::AFF7:DD44:F1FF
With the section 0000:0000 replaced by ::
The zero compression can only be applied ONCE to an IPv6 address, otherwise it would be
impossible to tell how many zeros were replaced on each occasion where it was applied. For
example, 8055:F2F2:0000:0000:FFF1:0000:0000:DD04 can be rewritten either as:

                               8055:F2F2::FFF1:0000:0000:DD04
or as:

                               8055:F2F2:0000:0000:FFF1::DD04
8055:F2F2::FFF1::DD04 is not a legal way of compressing the original address – we have no
way of knowing whether the original address was

                          8055:F2F2:0000:FFF1:0000:0000:0000:DD04
or

                          8055:F2F2:0000:0000:0000:FFF1:0000:DD04
or

                          8055:F2F2:0000:0000:FFF1:0000:0000:DD04
It would, therefore, be regarded as ambiguous.

Sub-netting
CIDR is actually based on sub-netting and the two are similar in many ways. Sub-netting
divides a LAN into two or more smaller networks. This helps reduce network traffic and can also
hide the complexity of the overall network. Recall that the IP address (using IPv4) is made up of
the netID and hostID. Suppose a university network has eight departments and has a netID of
192.200.20 (11000000.11001000.00010100). All of the devices on the university network will be
associated with this netID and can have hostID values from 00000001 to 1111110 (hostIDs

containing all 0s or all 1s are forbidden). The university network will look something like this:

Figure 2.23 An example of a university network

So, for example, the devices in the Admin and finance department might have hostIDs of 1, 8,
240, 35, 67, 88, 134, and so on, with similar spreads for the other seven departments.
It would be beneficial to organise the netIDs and hostIDs so that the network was a lot less
complex in nature. With sub-netting, the hostID is split as follows:
000 00000, where the first 3 bits are netID expansion and the last 5 bits are the hostIDs.
Thus, we have eight sub-nets with the same range of hostIDs.

 Department                                      netID              hostID range
 Admin and finance                               192.200.20.0       00001 to 11110
 Humanities                                      192.200.20.1       00001 to 11110
 Maths                                           192.200.20.2       00001 to 11110
 Science                                         192.200.20.3       00001 to 11110
 Arts                                            192.200.20.4       00001 to 11110
 Engineering                                     192.200.20.5       00001 to 11110
 Computing                                       192.200.20.6       00001 to 11110

 Business                                        192.200.20.7    00001 to 11110
Table 2.9

Figure 2.24 An example of a university network with netIDs

The devices in the Admin and finance department will have IP addresses

The Humanities department will have IP addresses

And so on for the other departments.
To obtain the netID from the IP address we can apply the AND mask (recall that 1 AND 1 = 1, 0
AND 0 = 0 or 1 AND 0 = 0). Thus, if a device has an IP address of

we can apply the AND mask

which results in the netID value

                      11000000.11001000.00010100.011 00000 (or 192.200.20.03)
This is the Science department. Consequently, the whole network is more efficient (for the
reasons stated above) and less complex. Compare this to CIDR 192/200/20/0/27, which extends
the size of the netID to 27 bits and has a hostID of only 5 bits, but would not reduce the
complexity of the network.

Private IP addresses and public IP addresses
Private IP addresses are reserved for internal use behind a router or other NAT device. The
following blocks are reserved for private IP addresses.

 Class A     10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255                  16 million possible addresses
 Class B     172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255                1 million possible addresses
 Class C     192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255              65 600 possible addresses
Table 2.10

Private IP addresses (which are internal value only) allow for an entirely separate set of
addresses within a network. They allow access to the network without taking up a public IP
address space. However, devices using these private IP addresses cannot be reached by internet
users.
Public IP addresses are the ones allocated by a user’s ISP to identify the location of their
device. Devices using these IP addresses are accessible from anybody using the internet. Public
IP addresses are used by
• DNS servers
• network routers
• directly-controlled computers.

2.2.4 Uniform resource service (URLs)
Web browsers are software that allow users to access and display web pages on their screens.
They interpret HTML sent from websites and display the results. Web browsers use uniform
resource locators (URL) to access websites; these are represented by a set of four numbers, such
as 109.108.158.1.
But it is much easier to type this into a browser using the following format:

Protocol is usually http or https
Website address is
• domain host (www)
• domain name (name of website)
• domain type (.com, .org, .net, .gov, and so on)
• (sometimes) a country code (.uk, .de, .cy, .br, and so on).
Path is the web page (if this is omitted then it is the root directory of the website)
Filename is the item from the web page

2.2.5 Domain name service (DNS)
The domain name service (DNS) (also known as domain name system) gives domain names for
internet hosts and is a system for finding IP addresses of a domain name. Domain names
eliminate the need for a user to memorise IP addresses. The DNS process involves converting a
host name (such as www.hoddereducation.co.uk) into an IP address the computer can understand
(such as 107.162.140.19).
Often, DNS servers contain a database of URLs with the matching IP addresses.

Figure 2.25 An example of the DNS process

① The user opens their web browser and types in the URL (www.hoddereducation.co.uk) and
  the web browser asks the DNS server (1) for the IP address of the website.
② The DNS server can’t find www.hoddereducation.co.uk in its database or its cache and sends
  out a request to DNS server (2).
③ DNS server (2) finds the URL and can map it to 107.162.140.19; the IP address is sent back
  to DNS server (1) which now puts the IP address and associated URL into its cache/database.
④ This IP address is then sent back to the user’s computer.
⑤ The computer now sets up a communication with the website server and the required pages
  are downloaded. The web browser interprets the HTML and displays the information on the
  user’s screen.

2.2.6 Scripting in HTML
This section considers HTML scripting using JavaScript and PHP. While this extends beyond the
syllabus, it is included here to help you understand how HTML is used to create websites and
how web browsers communicate with servers. It is included here for information and to aid
understanding.
A user may wish to develop a web application, which is client-server based, on their own
computer. To do this they would need to:
• download the necessary server software
• install the application on the chosen/allocated server
• use the web browser on their computer to access and interpret the application web pages.
Each web page would need to be created using HTML. A domain name would have to be
purchased from a web-hosting company. The HTML files would need to be uploaded to the
server which was allocated to the user by the web-hosting company.
HTML would be used to create a file using tags. For example:

Between the HTML tags the inclusion of JavaScript or PHP can be used.

JavaScript
JavaScript (unlike HTML) is a programming language which will run on the client-side. What
is the difference between running on the client-side and running on the server-side?
• Client-side – the script runs on the computer, which is making the request, processing the web
   page data that is being sent to the computer from the server.
• Server-side – the script is run on the web server and the results of processing are then sent to
   the computer that made the request.
The following short program inputs a temperature and outputs ‘HIGH’ if it is 200 °C or over,
‘OK’ if it is 100 °C or over and ‘LOW’ if it is below 100 °C.

PHP
PHP is another language which can be embedded within HTML. However, when PHP is used it
is processed on the server-side. Again, the code will be sandwiched inside HTML and will be
stored as a .php file.
The following example is similar to the JavaScript example; again temperatures are input but this
time ‘H’, ‘O’ and ‘L’ are output depending on the result. Note that variables begin with $ and are
case-sensitive.

  Data is being streamed at 1.5 Mbps and the media player is taking data at the rate 600 kbps.
  You may assume a megabit is 1 048 576 bits and a kilobit is 1024 bits.
  a) Explain why the buffer is needed.
                                                                                               [2]
   b) i) Calculate the amount of data stored in the buffer after 2 seconds of streaming and
          playback.
          You may assume that the buffer already contains 200 KiB of data.
                                                                                               [4]
      ii) By using different time values (such as 4 secs, 6 secs, 8 secs, and so on) determine
          how long it will take before the buffer reaches its higher limit (1.8 MiB).
                                                                                               [5]
  c) Describe how the problem calculated in part b) ii) can be overcome so that a 30-minute
      video can be watched without frequent pausing of playback.
                                                                                               [2]
5 a) When data is transmitted over a LAN network there is the possible risk of data collision.
      i) Explain the term data collision.
                                                                                               [2]
      ii) Describe how CSMA/CD is able to detect collisions.
                                                                                               [1]

   iii) Explain how CSMA/CD can be used to resolve the problem of data collision.
                                                                                    [2]
b) Copy the diagram below and connect each network device to its description.
                                                                                    [5]
